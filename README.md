# Adventures of Eorzea

This repository contains some (well, right now only one) adventures set in the world of [Eorzea](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Eorzea) meant to be played using the D&D5E System. I originally wrote these for my own and my friends' amusement but I wanted to share them as well.

I used Eorzea's setting just because I like it a lot, and I've been interested in it (as well as playing the game) ever since its original release. It should however be possible to adapt them into whatever setting you like, with some extra work.

The sources are the raw markdown stored over at [GMBinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/), plus the raw assets used therein. While all of this is technically accessible from GMBinder as well, I feel like its versioning capabilities are lacking and so I'd rather have a copy managed by Git as well.

# Reference material

None of this would have been possible without [Silent Soren's Companion Book](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIVxDnD/comments/aoxa5v/current_build_and_previous_versions/) and the [FFXIV x DnD Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIVxDnD/). Many thanks go towards them for helping us experience Eorzea as a roleplayable setting. I might sometime also refer to Soren's [Monsters of Eorzea and Beyond](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MA8Gcosm3gSpNBguS8-), which however has not yet been finalized.

A lot of lore-related material which is referenced in these adventures is available in printed form in the Encyclopaedia Eorzea [Volume 1](https://store.na.square-enix-games.com/en_US/product/421917/encyclopaedia-eorzea-the-world-of-final-fantasy-xiv-book) and [Volume 2](https://store.na.square-enix-games.com/en_US/product/500232/encyclopaedia-eorzea-the-world-of-final-fantasy-xiv-volume-2). At the time of writing  unfortunately both books are sold out, and Square Enix has not yet planned a reprint nor distributed them in digital form. You can however refer to community material like the [Final Fantasy Wiki](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV).

Last but not least I might make reference to the official D&D5E source books, both core and expansions. At the time of writing:

* [Player's Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb)
* [Dungeon Master's Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg)
* [Monster's Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm)
* [Xanathar's Guide to Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte)
