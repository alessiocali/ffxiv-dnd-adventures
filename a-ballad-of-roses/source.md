# A Ballad of Roses

##### A three-chapters Final Fantasy XIV - Dungeon & Dragons 5 Adventure

## Overview

This module is an adventure in three parts set in the world of Final Fantasy XIV, Hydaelyn. All sections take place in the area of Vylbrand, where the city-state of Limsa Lominsa is located. Encounters are balanced assuming a party of four characters of level six.

The first part takes place entirely in the city of Limsa Lominsa, where several activities are presented to the players to prepare for an upcoming mission. There is something to do in every of the city's most famous establishments, and they will have the opportunity to mingle with the most famous pirate crews of the thalassocracy.

In the second part, the players will journey to the outpost of Aleport, and make contact with the friendly Sahagins of Novv's Nursery. There they will try to secure the beastmen's collaboration to reach safely the Isles of Umbra, who are currently enveloped in a perpetual storm.

Finally, the players will explore the decadent and abandoned Pharos Sirius, a lighthouse notoriously damaged during the calamity. This dungeon is meant to be puzzle-intensive rather than fight-intensive and will offer a challenge to the players' wits on multiple occasions.

While the three parts have been built as a single journey, they are fairly modular and should be playable with no problem on their own, give or take some minor adjustments. Each of them is expected to take about twenty hours of playtime, depending on the players' celerity, that is.

A handy recap of all the potential rewards is available at the end of this module, namely under <a href="#appendix-loot">Appendix C</a>. They have been calibrated as the result of two dungeon forays in total.

## Summary: The Toll of the Sea (Player Safe)

Limsa Lominsa's inhabitants are in a constant state of unrest as of late. One too many ships have recently gone missing while on their way to Aleport, and as word has it the cause is to be searched into the no longer functioning lighthouse of the Isles of Umbra, Pharos Sirius.

Once the guide of many vessels, its light has faded ever since the Calamity. Naldiq & Vymelli's ironworks have tried, during the first years of the Seventh Umbral Era, to reclaim it, only to be welcomed by the sight of dozens of spikes of corrupted crystals surging with noxious aether.

The recent rise of alleged shipwrecks has however spurred once again the ironwork's engineers to investigate the matter personally. Word has spread all around Limsa that the ironworks are now looking for a group of adventurers to task with the reclamation of Pharos Sirius.

## Suggested Material

The following module contains references to the Basic Rules of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. There should be no references to any other of the core manuals, but the narrator is free to add any element as they like.

Regarding the integration within the world of Hydaelyn, the following homebrew manuals are assumed to be in play. I strongly recommend giving them a read as I will make references to some mechanics therein described (for example, the elemental crystals are part of the lootable rewards).

- Silent Soren's [Final Fantasy XIV D&D Compendium](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LsDqsNbupzeLhkTIcPv).
- Silent Soren's [Monsters of Hydaelyn](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MA8Gcosm3gSpNBguS8-).
- Remmus2k's [FFXIV World Compendium](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Ma6YF0Bq_JzCldr32eK).

In addition, references to the official lore books, the _Encyclopaedia Eorzea_ ([Volume 1](https://store.na.square-enix-games.com/en_US/product/672790/encyclopaedia-eorzea-the-world-of-final-fantasy-xiv-book) and [Volume 2](https://store.na.square-enix-games.com/en_US/product/672791/encyclopaedia-eorzea-the-world-of-final-fantasy-xiv-volume-ii-book)) are made whenever deemed appropriate. Unfortunately, these books are hard to come by and unavailable in digital format, so I will try to include a summary of the topic at hand whenever needed.

Whenever a manual reference is made, it will be in the format **XXX 123** , where the "XXX" is a tag to the manual name and "123" is the referenced page.

| **Tag** | **Referenced Book** |
| --- | --- |
| **BR** | Basic Rules |
| **FFWC** | FFXIV World Compendium |
| **SSC** | Silent Soren's Final Fantasy D&D Compendium |
| **EE1/EE2** | Encyclopaedia Eorzea 1/2 |

Other handy resources:

## Monetary Conversion

For simplicity of use, assume 1 gil = 1 copper piece. This puts the numerical values more or less aligned to your run-of-the-mill Final Fantasy game, where common utilities of good value are sold for 100 gils (1 gold piece) whereas more expensive gear can go in the tens or hundreds of thousands of gils (hundreds and thousands of gold pieces, respectively). This is also the same rate suggested in the Final Fantasy XIV World Compendium.

## Story Introduction (Narrator Only)

Of the many creatures that inhabit Eorzea, some of the most intriguing are without doubt those classified as _Spoken_. The most notable examples of members of this genus are for sure the so-called _enlightened_ species, like the five races of Eorzea, and the beast tribes. However, a species, in particular, has never quite found its place among the civilized, nor has ever been witnessed as having a civilization on its own. Once terrible predators of the sea, the creatures known as Sirens are nowadays practically extinct, following a purge lead by the legendary pirate Mistbeard – or at least one of its incarnations.

> ##### Mistbeard and the Sirens
> 
> The name of Mistbeard is the stuff of legend: initially belonging to a pirate in the XIII century of the Sixth Astral Era, his mask and name are but an alias which is being passed on from one owner to the other.
> 
> Its latest impersonator has last been seen under Mistbeard's guise 22 years ago (1555 6AE), and as rumor would have it, it was none other than Grand Marshal Eynzahr Slafyrsyn – although to this day it remains but a gossip.
> 
> Among the most notable recent undertakings of Pirate King Rycharde Mistbeard, the most famous was with no doubts the eradication of all Sirens, humanoid winged creatures who wield powerful charming spells, said to lure ships ashore and to feed on the very souls of the castaways – although the latter has never been confirmed and is believed to be no more than a wives' tale.
> 
> It is unclear whether the siren genocide was at the hand of Eynzahr or his predecessor – all that is certain is that this event happened at some point in the fifty years preceding year 5 7UE. For the sake of this story, we'll assume the genocide happened about thirty years ago. See **EE1 288** and [Mirke's Menagerie's post](https://mirkemenagerie.tumblr.com/post/145064487669/nefzenffxiv-scales-and-heretics-ooc) on the subject.

\columnbreak

### Himerope, the Last Siren

This story starts with one of the few survivors of this plumed race. During Mistbeard's eradication about twenty-five years before the Seventh Umbral Calamity, Himerope was but a fledgling chick of five summers. As the pirate's genocide proceeded, he eventually found Himerope's mother's nest and, as his axe fell as swift as thunder, she too lost her life to the pirate king. In an attempt to spare her offspring, however, she clutched onto her only daughter, the fledgling Himerope, hiding her from sight before Mistbeard could see her.

Incapable of moving and paralyzed by fear and by the shock of seeing her mother murdered, she stood there, waiting for the captain and his crewmates to move on to their next target. After hopelessly trying to reanimate her mother, Himerope abandoned her endeavors and, with no other option left, she had to resolve to live on her own.

In the years that followed Himerope resorted to every method possible to survive. As she soon found out, her kind was blessed with innate charming abilities. She learned to prey on isolated groups of adventurers, lured by her chant, and to loot their stocks of food. The years went by and Himerope was always on the run, chased by the few survivors of her raids. Eventually, few months before the Calamity befell, she found shelter in the Isles of Umbra, south of Aleport. The area was once a lominsan outpost thanks to the lighthouse of Pharos Sirius, but as Dalamud reached closer to Eorzea every engineer and caretaker had left their post.

### Unexpected admirers

Things changed when one day a young thavnairian lady found herself ashore, when her ship fell victim to a terrible and sudden storm, unable to navigate due to the lighthouse being abandoned. The sole survivor of the shipwreck, Beatrix, a red-haired bard in search of fortune in Eorzea, eventually made her way to the top of the lighthouse from where, now and then, Himerope was singing alone, to keep herself company. Wary of all the enlightened, Himerope initially threatened Beatrix's life but, to her surprise, she only wished to hear more of her chant. Their common passion for music brought the two closer as Beatrix tried to find a way home, and they spent more and more time together.

> ##### More than just friends?
> For the sake of narration I will refer to Beatrix and Himerope as just being "friends", but you can establish a deeper bond to better justify Himerope's actions. I'm not that good at depicting romance though, so I will stick with "friendship".

Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worst the day of the Calamity. As Dalamud approached Carteneau, the two took shelter in the lighthouse, in hope of saving themselves from the impact. But once the red moon reached proximity with the ground, and as the dreadwyrm Bahamut freed himself from his ancient prison, the lighthouse was struck with one of its shards, and in the ensuing mayhem, Beatrix was caught in a sudden surge of aether from the damaged structure. Himerope miraculously survived unscathed but, she soon found out, Beatrix's body ended up encased in a crystalline structure that had formed at the top of the lighthouse.

### The oath to protect

Unable to free Beatrix from her aetherial prison, Himerope resolved to guard her newfound friend, hoping that the crystal energy would weaken over time. Making use of her charming song, she made sure that every inbound ship, carrying explorers that aimed at retaking the lighthouse, would meet an early demise.


As time passed, however, things inside the crystal started developing the opposite way as Himerope hoped. Beatrix's body started to twist as a result of her exposition to the dreadwyrm's aether, and with it, the crystal started to emanate a power of its own. The local fauna gathered inside the lighthouse's structure, driven to madness by the corrupted aether, and the bodies of the shipwrecked rose again as mindless crystal zombies.

As the situation started getting out of hand, Himerope realized that the only way to have her friend back was to let the Lominsans reatake the lighthouse – and destroy the crystal in the process. Swallowing her age-long hate for the people of Eorzea, she donned a magical charm Beatrix showed her during her travels. Using the power of the charm, she took on Beatrix's appearance and started roaming La Noscea as an adventurer, seeking opportunities to join a reclamation party.

\columnbreak

Soon after that, a violent, perpetual storm started forming around the Isles of Umbra, making her mission all the more unlikely to succeed…

> ##### Beatrix or Himerope?
> 
> From this point on, whenever referring to "Beatrix" I will imply the Beatrix-glamoured Himerope, rather than the "real" Beatrix stuck at the summit of Pharos Sirius unless otherwise specified. The ambiguity will be cleared at the end of the adventure, once Himerope reveals herself.

## A few notes on canonicity

The events in this story are loosely inspired by those transpired by the Pharos Sirius dungeon from Final Fantasy XIV. In this variant, I liked to imagine a deeper story to the Siren who lured pirates ashore. After all, there are in-game references of the Siren perhaps captivating her victims in a desperate attempt to soothe her loneliness.

To spice things up inside the lighthouse, I reimagined it as a marvel of Eorzean technology with a bit of Garlean ingenuity in-between, thanks to the aid of a defecting engineer who is, despite his talent, an insufferable prankster. For the sake of the story, I also imagined the crystal shard, visible from outside the structure, as a sort of crystal tree erupted from the lighthouse's aether compressor, and its "corrupted aether" as an emanation of the lingering will of Bahamut, fueled by the Dalamud shard embedded in its structure. The nature of the lighthouse minions has been adapted as well, from being thrall of the Siren to being vicious creatures ensnared by the shard.

While these changes are free creative adaptations, they shouldn't be too drastic compared to the Eorzean canon and should not impact significantly an ongoing faithful campaign. You are, as always, free to adapt the details to suit your needs.

# The Rose of May

The missing ships are not the only buzz of Limsa's streets. In recent days, a bard maiden of extraordinary skills has graced the city with her presence: known by the common folks as _The Rose of May_, Beatrix is a red-haired Hyur in her late twenties. She is an attractive woman of fair complexion, with few freckles adorning her visage, who are complemented by her hazelnut-colored eyes.

She wears a green and white bandana with a dotted pattern between two mono chromatic stripes, which only partly covers her head while leaving her hairs free on the other side. Her shirt is white with long puffed sleeves and not too revealing on the chest. It is kept together by a green sash adorned with a golden chain with silvery disks hanging down from it. Her legs are covered by a pair of comfortable rugged pants and she wears a pair of sandals as her footwear.

During her time at Limsa Lominsa, she became well known at the Drowning Wench for her daily exhibits, where the sweet notes of her harp are only matched by her charming voice. Her songs tell of ages past, of the conquest of the sea and the adventures of pirates of yore. Her knowledge of Limsa's history and legends is surprising for her young age which makes her tales all the more captivating.

Surprisingly, little is known about her past. Given her talent, one would expect her fame to precede her, yet nobody has ever heard of her in or outside Limsa Lominsa before three years prior when she suddenly made her appearance in Aleport. She claims to come from Thavnair, but it is hard to confirm such a claim as visitors from the Eastern island are ever so rare, especially since the lighthouse of Pharos Sirius stopped functioning.

### Starting the adventure

The players will embark on an expedition to clear Pharos Sirius of any infesting pest and ascertain its status on behalf of Naldiq & Vymelli's. Their motivations could be as simple as earning a monetary reward, or as specific as requesting a very special work of ironmongery from their smiths, whatever suits the context.

As for how the party comes to learn of the job offer, here are a few options to consider:

- While browsing for goods from a local merchant, they notice a lack in the inventory. Inquiring the merchant, they will complain how they were expecting a shipment a few weeks ago, which unfortunately never arrived. They suspect the cargo to have shipwrecked, as many have as of late, and will direct the party to Naldiq & Vymelli's for further inquiry.
- The party needs to commission a work to the best smiths in town. While asking around, they are promptly directed to Naldiq & Vymelli's. They are however warned of recent troubles and that they might not be able to help them.
- During one of their journeys, the party members spend their night at the Drowning Wench, where they are witnesses to one of Beatrix's daily exhibitions. Beatrix will approach the party, having spotted from glance a group of seasoned adventurers, and propose the job offer on behalf of Naldiq & Vymelli's, from which she has just been hired.

For more specific situations, one or more of the players might be involved with one of the many characters that will take part in the expedition.

# A Sirius Engagement

The headquarters of the Blacksmiths and Armorers guild, that is Naldiq & Vymelli's ironworks, is a relatively small forge located in the upper level of Limsa Lominsa. Historically they have been Limsa's best, if not the Hydaelyn's best shipwrights. As of late, they have broadened their activities, under the guidance of master H'naanza Esi, and the tutoring of the forgemaster Brithael Spade, who are now welcoming adventurers from all over Eorzea interested in learning the craft of their smiths.

<div class="descriptive">

As you enter the cobblestone hall of Naldiq & Vymelli's you are not-so welcomed by the intense heat radiated by its forges, the smell of burning coal and heating metal, and the rhythmic beating of smithies as they clang, over and over, on the same iridescent iron block.

You are immediately stopped by a soot-haired Miqo'te woman, wearing a pair of roundish black goggles, which prevent you from deciphering her mood. "_Sorry pals, we've got our hands full right now, no more requests. Or are you here for some other reason?_".

</div>

The Miqo'te is none other than H'naanza herself, chairwoman of the ironworks. After the party presents their reason for coming, she gives them a rundown of what has been happening.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:50px"></div>

*[Screenshot source](https://mobile.twitter.com/coeurlclaw/status/1079163152636379136)*

- In the last months, several shipments have gone missing while on their route to Limsa. They all had one thing in common: they were supposed to land at the harbor of Aleport, and their naval route was meant to pass nearby the isles of Umbra.
- The isles were once known for their lighthouse, Pharos Sirius, which has however been damaged during the calamity and never been restored.
- The reason the lighthouse was never reclaimed is because of the abundance of corrupted crystals in the area. The over-aspected aether overflowing from these crystals is noxious for most living beings, making any expedition inside the tower a suicidal attempt.
- The region has been historically infamous for causing numerous shipwrecks ever since the Calamity, but in the last years, the area has been enveloped in a potent and perpetual storm, which is suspected to have lately grown worse.

After deliberation from Admiral Bloefhiswyn, the ironworks have been assigned the task to organize one conclusive operation to restore Pharos to its functionality and purge it of any wicked beast that might have made of it their home.

To reach their goal the ironworks have started assembling a team of professionals to tackle the obvious problems for this expedition.

### Sebeku Nebeku – The Aetherologist

This lalafellin researcher from Old Sharalayan has been researching aether and how living creatures are affected by their inner balance of it for his whole life. After the Calamity, he has traveled to Eorzea to shift his attention to over-aspected aether crystals which have surged from the ground in several locations all over the region following Bahamut's attack.

He has been commissioned to research a way to shield a relatively small crew against the damaging effects of the corrupted crystals. Just recently he finally reached a turning point, and his work brought the development of the Aetherial Syphon, a device that, when held by a person, can absorb moderate excess of aether coming from the environment, like a sort of sponge, thus preventing its owner to be harmed by it.

> ##### Wait a minute…
> 
> One might assume the Aetherial Syphon would be the ultimate protection against a Primal's tempering, given its properties. Unfortunately, the focused stream of aether emanated from a Primal intended to temper is too strong for the Syphon to bear, and would soon shatter it, voiding its protection.

The Syphon requires periodic maintenance to function properly, a complex procedure that only Sebeku can replicate. Therefore, he needs to be part of the group entering the lighthouse for them to proceed without harm. He is also charged with evaluating the situation inside and note any criticality regarding the aetherial imbalance of the area.

\columnbreak

### Beatrix Seaworth – The Recruiter

Notorious for her talents both as a musician and adventurer ever since she showed up in Limsa Lominsa three years prior, Beatrix heard quickly of Naldiq & Vymelli's planned expedition and took on herself the job of finding capable adventurers to clear the ground of Pharos Sirius, so that the ironwork's engineers could later safely conduct their analysis.

A capable sorceress herself, she intends to accompany the party in their exploration, sure to be of help with her enchanting tunes.

#### Playing as Beatrix in battle

Beatrix is a 6th-level Bard with some unique abilities given her secret identity as a Siren. Refer to the stat block in this page for quick use.

\pagebreakNum

### The reward

Should the party succeed, Naldiq & Vymelli's offer 100'000 gils to each participating person or, as an alternative, will accept to forge anything of equal value (within their capabilities). Furthermore, the adventurers have free qualm in reclaiming any spoil they will find within the lighthouse, which was home to intense commercial activity and research before being abandoned in a rush due to the Calamity.

### (Not so) Ready for Departure

Before the expedition could start, there is still an important matter to settle: finding safe passage to the Isles of Umbra. Normally, any pirate crew worth their boots would be capable of granting such – however, the perpetual storm around Umbra complicates matters. Therefore the party is given their first task: securing a means of transport, and the way to protect it on its way to the Islands. H'naanza, on behalf of Naldiq & Vymelli's, offers to cover up any expense that might arise as a consequence.

Before the party leaves, she offers a sachet of linkpearls to stay in touch. They are free to call her at any moment should they require assistance or directions within the city. The two tasks are described as two side-quests in the following chapters, that can be run independently or in parallel. From this point on, try to follow your players' reasoning and direct them accordingly. Use this opportunity to show them around the city and its landmarks, trying maybe to avoid already seen places (for example, if the adventure started at the Drowning Wench, suggest them to look at Hawker's Alley instead). If you need a refresher on Limsa Lominsa and its custom, **EE1 094** is your best source of information.

# A Pirate's Life for Me

Albeit it is undoubtful that the rise to power of Admiral Bloefhiswyn has settled many of Limsa Lominsa's internal quarrels, not all pirates – pardon me, _privateers_ – have taken well the ratification of the Galadion accord. Some crews have quickly adapted to the new style of life – namely, Carvallaine's Kraken Arms – but others have started languishing in idleness, much to their crew's discontent.

While still technically the most powerful, and fearful of the three dominant pirate crews, the Bloody Executioners' _Astalicia_ has not set anchor in years, following their leader's – One-Eyed Hyllfyr – retirement. As rumors have it, the old Roegadyn suffers from an ailment to the lungs, and albeit his presence alone is enough to keep the Lominsan underworld in check, there are several who would jump at each other's throat for a chance at claiming the role of his successor.

But the party who had it worst is with no doubt Rhoswen Leach's Sanguine Sirens. This women-only crew was once the terror of the coastal region, thanks to their swift vessels, but they now spend most of their time holed in their tavern and headquarter, the Missing Member, lacking legitimate targets for their plunders.

As days passed by their fortunes started to diminish and while the crew can still sustain itself, it is with no doubt that the quality of the ale has declined, each member has fewer gils in their pockets, and the general idleness can't but exacerbate the overall situation of discomfort.

And so, when the Red Spear, a minor vessel under the Sirens' control, returned with a cargo of spoilt or otherwise useless goods from a Garlean trade ship, a certain lalafellin accountant thought to exploit the situation to turn the tides. Lororu Roru, the administrative accountant of the Sirens, sought a partnership with an acquaintance of hers, a low-class Miqo'te swindler named E'ranu Tia, owner of the Bloated Belly, an all-trades half-failed shop in the alleys near Fisherman's Bottom.

\columnbreak

True to his fame, E'ranu quickly thought of a way to "repurpose" the spoilt goods. In the following days, he sought the Seventh Sage storage and its delivery men and secretly switched their wares with those coming from the Sirens. With the Kraken's reputation compromised, E'ranu would have then taken their place as Limsa's establishments' main supplier, reselling lower-quality (but usable) materials coming from the Sirens instead.

Thanks to her position as an accountant, it was easy for Lororu to mask the disappearance of the spoils to fuel her scheme – and so she and E'ranu quickly gained riches for their own. That was until the damaged parties started to seriously take things into their hands…

### Starting the quest

The players are tasked with finding an expert crew that would grant them a passage to the Isle of Umbra. While Limsa Lominsa is not one place to lack expert sailors, they are suggested to first try to contact someone from two of the three most powerful groups: Carvallaine de Gorgagne's Kraken's Arms, at the Seventh Sage; and Rhoswen Leach's Sanguine Sirens, at the Missing Member.

As for Hyllfyr's Bloody Executioners, currently stationed at the Astalicia, their internal organization has fallen in disarray since the formal retirement of their leader, and their internal factions are too busy bickering for who is going to succeed old One-Eyed to lend any adventurer their aid.

As part of the quest introduction, they can petition help from either the Krakens or the Sirens, in all which cases they will be involved in revealing Lororu's scheme. Alternatively, they can be given a hint at any of the investigation's hotspots, from where they can start the investigation independently.

## Investigation Summary

You can use the table below to track the players' progress and have a general idea of where they can gather clues. In general, they will have to draw two conclusions:

1. The Bloated Belly is reselling loot from the Sirens, unbeknownst to their Captain, while also taking over the Kraken's Arms trade.
2. Lororu Roru, the Sirens' accountant, is the one who made this possible and hid the spoils' disappearance.

### Kraken's Arms – Hijacked Business

A simple preliminary investigation on the Kraken's Arms whereabouts reveals the players that the Seventh Sage – officially an establishment in herbs, exotic spices, and the likes – is, to pretty much everyone's knowledge, the Arms' storefront, where the fruits of all their plunders end up. Carvallaine de Gorgagne, the Arms' captain, is, unlike many others of his _colleagues_, an approachable and affable fellow. When not at sea, he likes to spend his time on the balcony on the back of the Seventh Sage or sipping wine at the Drowning Wench – a remnant habit of his past life as an Ishgardian young nobleman.

He is more than available at discussing business with the players' group, at one condition.

<div class="descriptive">

_If you seek to reach the Isle of Umbra, I think you could not find more apt carriers than my fine crew. As you can imagine though, we do not deal in charity. So, what if I propose a little exchange?_

_Me and my subordinates, you see, deal in fine "spices" from all over Hydaelyn. However, one of our most renowned clients, the Bismarck, has recently cut ties with us, under the accuse of providing poisonous herbs instead of the usual condiments._

_That is of course preposterous, we are as always very meticulous in our trade. But I cannot deny that I have heard of one too many patrons of good old Lyngsath leaving their table with excruciating stomach pains._

_Now, the place had to shut off for two weeks while they were running an internal investigation and has just now opened again. We, however, are still cut from dealing with them. I find all this very suspicious if you ask me._

_So, this is the deal: shed some light on this culinary business and help me reestablish our contract, and I can guarantee you my finest helmsman's help._

</div>

Carvallaine suggests the party starting their investigation at the Bismarck itself, now that it is again accepting customers.

### Sanguine Sirens – Missing Goods

The Missing Member is not a tavern too welcoming towards its masculine clients. And after all, what could one expect from the Sirens' very headquarters? Players inquiring for their help are initially met with scorn by each one of the presents. That is until Rhoswen Leach, their leader, slams her mug on a wooden table, ordering everyone to leave at once.

<div class="descriptive">

_Ye've got some balls to show yer face 'ere all-mighty asking us for a passage like I'm some bloody Chocobo Porter. And usually, I would intimate you to leave lest me deprive you of those and something else as well. But today's yer lucky day and ye could prove yerself of use._

_I'll go straight to the point. I smell a rat amongst me ranks. And I can't trust anyone to look into the matter but an outsider. Lately, our ships could not 'eve been fuller with goods, as we caught some Garlean fucks on their way to Cartenau. Yet me coffers are emptier by the day. So, either I'm blind as a bat or somebody here's been smuggling our goods under me nose._

_If ye can find what's of the two and bring me whoever thought they could fuck with me, ye can consider us having a deal. But fuck it up and… well, let's just say I will explain ye why this place is called the Missing Member._

</div>

As a first place to search, she suggests checking Mealvaan's Gate, where all taken goods need to pass inspection.

\pagebreakNum

## Investigation Hotspots

#### The Bismarck

After inquiring about the owner's, Lyngsath Hyllbornsyn, whereabouts, the party finds out that the month before the place has received several deliveries of suspicious herbs which while at first sight looked like an exotic, edible variety, turned out to be poisonous. Trade has resumed after they cut contacts with the Seventh Sage and established a contract with another supplier, although the ingredients are of lesser quality. The supplier in question is the Bloated Belly, a so-far unknown shop down at Fisherman's Bottom.

If the group asks to inspect the sacks, they find them to be full of what looks like common rosemary, but upon closer inspection (**DC 17 Nature** check) they turn out indeed to be a similar herb that is thought to grow within Garlemald's territory. This variety, however, can cause digestive issues and stomach pain when ingested and is usually processed by alchemical means to produce oils that protect steel surfaces from oxidating. Contrary to some nearby sacks from a previous, legit stock, these sacks do not sport the Seventh Sage's logo.

#### Naldiq & Vymelli's

Another of Carvallaine's clients, the smiths of Naldiq & Vymelli's are used to buy raw ores, refined metals, and scrapped weapons to smelt which are usually looted from Garlean vessels. Upon inquiring if something is amiss with the Kraken's shipments, H'naanza reveals that a recently delivered stock of what was supposed to be iron ore turned out to be nothing more than coal. While they can still make use of it, it is in no way worth what they paid for it, and she was in the process of issuing a formal complaint.

Upon inspecting the crates of ores, a similar issue as the Bismarck herbs arises: contrary to how the Krakens crates are branded, these are not. If asked about the delivery, H'naanza will point the players to one of the Seventh Sage delivery boys. The boy is well known, and nothing was suspicious at the time of delivery.

The boy can be found taking a break outside of the Seventh Sage. When approached on the topic, he is reluctant and fidgeting. He can be forced to talk with a **DC 10 Persuasion, Intimidation,** or **Deception** check: on the day of the delivery, he briefly lost sight of the crates, and when he took them on him, they felt slightly different – they didn't weigh the same.

<div class='descriptive'>

"_At the time I didn't notice it, but… I don't think they had our logo either. And then yesterday I heard from a friend at Naldiq & Vymelli's that the crates were full of coal! Would you imagine that? Oh man, I am so screwed now…"_

</div>

#### The Seventh Sage

Since it seems that Carvallaine's trade has been somehow attacked, a perfect starting point for an investigation is the very same storefront of his business. The store clerk doesn't have a lot of information to share, claiming that nothing wrong has ever been detected with their wares. They however suggest asking the storekeeper, who is more directly involved with their storage.

The storekeeper immediately turns their guard up the moment someone mentions the poisonous herbs and refuses to answer unless convinced otherwise (**DC 10 Persuasion, Intimidation** or **Deception**). As it turns out, few days before the delivery he found that the storage entrance was forced overnight. However, when he inspected the wares, nothing felt amiss. Except…

<div class="descriptive">

"_Well… it didn't seem a big deal, but a few sacks of rosemary didn't have our logo on them. It happens sometimes, you know, we use generic unbranded ones when we have a particularly generous stock. And the content looked the same, so I thought no damage was done. And then the thing with the Bismarck happened, and I knew immediately what it was. But I couldn't force myself to talk, it would have been the end of me…"_

</div>

#### Mealvaan's Gate

Whenever a ship, whether it is a privateering vessel or a trading cargo, drops the anchor at Limsa's port, it has to undergo inspection at Mealvaan's Gate, to ensure they respect the lominsan laws, do not promote illegal trade, and pay the proper customs.

The registries are available for the public to inspect, under the overseeing of an authorized member of the Arcanist Guild. While there are numerous records of shipments coming from the Sanguine Sirens, one particular detail strikes as odd: a certain ship, the Red Spear, has reported stocks of trade goods that are different from their previous spoils. While the Spear used to trade in weapons and jewels, in the last two months it brought back herbs, fire powder, iron ores, and chemical reagents, spoils which are more commonly associated with the Krakens. While there is no record of where these materials are destined, the guild member comments on how lately there have been problems with supplies at the Blacksmith Guild.

#### The Missing Member

Just because they are former pirates, it doesn't mean that, as any reasonable trader, the privateers of the Sanguine Sirens do not hold records of all their exchanges. After inquiring about where they can find more information about their business, the players are directed at Lororu Roru, a lalafellin woman in her early thirties. She wears a long red coat to show her membership, to which an array of throwing knives are appended. She has long blonde hair and wears a pair of prescription glasses. Not suited for the sea activity, Lororu has been appointed accountant for her cleverness and ability with numbers and coin – and, also, for her relationship with certain members of the goods inspectorate, who helped the Siren have a treatment of favor in more than one occasion.

\pagebreakNum

Mildly annoyed by the interruption of her business, she tilts her glasses, sighs, and brings them a huge register filled to the brim with details of each of the Sirens' ships' affair. Curiously, while several ships are mentioned, one in particular – the Red Spear – has last reported a shipment two months before, and not a single one after. If questioned about them, Lororu mentions that their crew is in a particularly bad looting streak, not having managed to secure successful plunders since then.

#### Ferry Docks

Close to Mealvaan's Gate, the Docks are the place where it's easier to find idle privateers waiting for inspection. Several Sanguine members are present as well, including one of the vice-captains bored to death for a particularly long queue. If questioned, she mentions how she hasn't noticed anything unusual from her peers' trade, and that, in fact, things have been going pretty well lately ever since the Red Spear spotted a regular Garlean trade route through Merlthor Strait towards Carteneau. Oddly enough, she comments, the Spear is rumored to have not submitted one single ounce of their plunders' fruit and is considered as having a "bad streak".

#### Dutiful Sisters of the Edelweiss

Any character more well versed in the underworld would know these outlaw vigilantes. Jacke Swallow, the master of the Rogues' guild, is not one to welcome too nosy people. He does, however, start to open up at the mention of weird affairs going on with the Sirens and Krakens trade. While he does not have any conclusive evidence, he did notice something peculiar: ever since the Bismarck had to shut down under the allegation of serving poisoned dishes, a certain gods-forgotten trade spot – the Bloated Belly – has risen in affairs. Significantly. As in, tenfold the amounts of customers and deliveries. More importantly, it seems to have consistently tried to take the place of the Seventh Sage as the Bismarck and Naldiq & Vymelli's supplier.

#### The Astalicia

If you want to mingle with the lominsan pirates, there is no better place than the Astalicia. Flagship of the bloody executioners, this imposing vessel is now permanently docked at the lower decks and has since become a gathering spot for bandits, cutthroats, and all sorts of less-likable fellows. And drunkards.

<div class='descriptive'>

"TEN THOSHANDSH GILSH! TEN THOUSHANDS I TELL YE! A MONTH! BESHT THING IMMAH LAIF…."

</div>

The loud voice of a guy way past his tenth mug can be heard from anywhere on the ship. Apparently, he recently found the proverbial golden goose under the employment of the Bloated Belly as a sales representative. The business has been blooming lately, and the owner is hiring more and more people to promote his enterprise. He warmly invites everyone to try and "_SHPIN THE WHEEL!"_, whatever that means.

\pagebreakNum

## The Bloated Belly

<div class='wide'>
<a href='https://i.postimg.cc/vHJ8wFvd/Bloated-Belly.webp' target="_blank">
<img class='map' src='https://i.postimg.cc/vHJ8wFvd/Bloated-Belly.webp'/>
</a>
</div>

Close to Fisherman's Bottom, down at Limsa Lominsa's lower decks, lies a less frequented network of rogue shops, black markets, and all sorts of illicit trade establishments. Usually, only the bravest (or dumbest) adventurer would put a step in there – yet somehow lately the place became crowded with commonfolk as well. Everyone seems interested in visiting the Bloated Belly, an easy-to-miss locale amidst the poorly lit alleys.

For sure, the place is not one to forget once you spot it. Its gross, decrepit banner depicts a poor taste representation of a Roegadyn pirate whose stomach burst open revealing a stash of gold coins inside. And the storefront doesn't help much either: empty, dusty, with just a few jars of… something, which might be edible – or used for construction work – or both, you're not quite sure.

#### The Front Entrance

It doesn't take too much time waiting to see a few customers come and go. If questioned, they mention that, while the store doesn't look much from outside, it has an impressive stock of various goods in its back storage. Some of the regulars, if specifically questioned about unusual events around the shop, also mention the following facts:

- One night, one of them saw a short, hooded figure (the height of a Lalafell) entering the shop way past its closing hour. They are also sure that person dropped something near the entrance by accident, after bumping on the opening door.
- The shop owner has been seen visiting an optic artisan who has a laboratory at Hawker's Alley. He, however, doesn't have any glasses, nor has been seen with a pair ever since.

Indeed, the remnants of half of a broken pair of glasses are found by investigating the front entrance (**DC 15 Perception** if searching blindly, instant success otherwise). The frame is too damaged to make heads from tails of it. However, the optic clearly remembers the owner's request: a very specific pair of prescription glasses for a lalafellin fellow.

> ##### About the glasses
>
> These have been dropped by Lororu one night when she visited the shop in secret to make further agreements with E'ranu. While she did have a spare pair, she handed over to E'ranu a list of specifications for a new one. E'ranu later went to the optic at Hawker's Alley to have them crafted.

\pagebreakNum

#### Inside the Shop

As much decrepit as it is easy to imagine, there is nothing of interest from the barely 15x15 feet room which constitutes the shop's entrance. The leonine-looking E'ranu Tia (a **Scout BR 401**) warmly welcomes every patron from behind his counter. He tries to pry out as much information as possible from every customer which is not a regular, before deciding whether to allow them inside or not, in an attempt to filter out potential "troublemakers". His skepticism is easily removed, however, at any proposition of good affairs.

Once his trust is gained, he invites the party inside, through a door behind him. The door leads to a much wider storage room, filled to the brim with goods for sale: there are tall shelves in every conceivable place, that turn its insides into a labyrinthine mess. A crammed desk has an almost miraculous spot amidst this chaos, although it's in no way less chaotic than the rest.

E'ranu lets inside only one person at a time, while keeping close eyes on them. He is extremely vigilant and will react to any suspicious behavior – like trying to investigate the desk – first with a warning and then by calling out two guards from outside (**Veterans BR 403**). If the fight turns for the worse, he flees for his life without caring too much about the shop.

If he is put out of commission, he doesn't have a lot on his own, except for a prescription for glasses. As for the desk, on top of it in clear sight is the other half of the broken glasses found outside, and, inside a drawer, the following letter:

<div class='descriptive'>

_The next shipment is going to be delayed. The Garleans must have found another route – it was almost a miracle they stuck to that passage for so long. Keep selling what we have, the deal is unchanged._

</div>

The message has no recognizable symbol on it, but its writing is so small and precise that it could only possibly belong to a Lalafell – and one quite used to the quill as well. If the players previously investigated the Sirens' accounting book, they will be able to realize (**DC 20 Intelligence**) that the calligraphy is the same.

#### The Rear Entrance

While the place looks relatively modest inside from the main entrance, the building itself is fairly large, from which it is easy to deduce that it might be larger than it looks. There is a rear entrance that is guarded by two **Veterans (BR 403)**. The storage is constantly guarded even at late night, with guards taking turns every 8 hours (starting at midnight). If the guards are distracted or taken out of commission, the door is locked but easy to pick (**DC 10 Dexterity** , allow advantage with locksmith tools). The owner runs the shop between 8 am and 8 pm. He can be seen entering and leaving from the back entrance.

A few interesting facts can be gathered by investigating the surroundings:

- Not far from the rear entrance there is a waste yard with several abandoned sacks. Some of them sport the Sanguine Sirens' logo.
- There is a set of tiny, recent footsteps near the entrance, that can only possibly belong to a Lalafell. This strikes as odd since none of the people seen around there (the guards, the smuggling sirens, or the proprietor) belong to that race.

#### The Siren Smugglers

Every late night the shop is visited by a few pirates who bring various sacks and boxes of random wares, ranging from weapons to jewelry, to culinary ingredients. The pirates are easily identified as members of the Sanguine Sirens.

If the party manages to capture one of the Sirens, she turns out to be a member of the Red Lance, and she and her crewmates have been secretly smuggling their spoils under Rhoswen's nose.

<div class='descriptive'>

"_I ain't no fool, mind ye. That ain't my idea, we've got an official order. From where beats me. All 'em higher-ups, vice-captains and whatnot can issue one, and they all share the same seal. All I know is that me and me matey's share has been quite good lately e'er since we started this trade."_

## Facing Lororu

At this point the players would have enough clues to deduce the identity of the person who's run the trading scheme in the first place:

- It must be a higher-up of the Sirens.
- It is a Lalafell.
- It wears glasses.

The only person fitting the description is the accountant, Lororu Roru. She is easily recognized if the players have met her, but any member of the Siren can identify her as well given these details. She is usually found in her office at the Missing Member.

She is initially dismissive about any of the party's claims, suggesting coincidences or inconclusive proof. If pressed with enough evidence, however, she attempts to flee using a hidden gun inside one of her desk's drawers. The gun is loaded with blinding ammunition: everyone in the radius of 60 feet must make a **DC 15 Dexterity** check to cover their eyes in time or be blinded for 12 seconds. Her escape route goes through a door on the back, which leads to a balcony and down a rope to the lower decks. Down at the base of one of Limsa's towers she prepared a small escape boat, aiming to reach the coast near Zephyr Drift in Middle La Noscea. If the party manages to surround her, she doesn't oppose resistance and surrenders.

\columnbreak

Captured or not, the office has plenty of proof for Lororu's deeds:

- Inside one of the drawers, there are several notes of payments from the Sirens' coffers directly to the crew of the Red Lance.
- Another stash of payment notes is directed from the Bloated Belly to Lororu directly and stored within a safe. Lororu has both the key and the combination, but the safe can be opened by a skilled thief (**DC 20 Dexterity** , allow advantage with lockpicking tools) or magically (for example with a **Knock** spell).
- Just under a removable axis (**DC 18 Perception**), is hidden a list of records of the missing goods from the Red Lance, and notes about where they could be directed: the poisonous herbs to the Bismarck, coal to Naldiq & Vymelli's, but also low-quality, aetherically unsuitable ink to the Arcanists of Mealvaan's Gate.

### Conclusion

Once Lororu's scheme is exposed, the party can return to their quest giver (either Carvallaine or Rhoswen). Both are pleased whether they caught Lororu in the process or just managed to bring sufficient proof of her deeds and honor their promise of granting them a passage to Umbra at their earliest convenience. As a bonus reward, if the players manage to bring Lororu, E'ranu, or both to justice, they are awarded 10'000 gils each per captive.

## Fishy advice

Convincing a pirate crew to lend their help to reach Umbra should be easy enough. What is less easy, however, is figuring out how they could make sure their ship doesn't meet an early demise at a storm's hand. Everyone from Naldiq & Vymelli's team has a proposition on where to start looking, each leading to a different encounter and sequence of events.

All the following encounters are designed to have the players make acquaintances with the goblin merchant Swiswix Gillytalx. You can decide how many of them to run – as little as one, meaning the party will immediately meet him right after, or to chain them following a series of NPC clues.

### Hawker's Alley

Although simple, Beatrix has the most straightforward idea:

<div class='descriptive'>

_People tend to gather around shops, right? We should check the marketing area then. Maybe somebody will know better._

</div>

Located in the lower decks, Hawker's Alley is the main trade road of the city-state. Merchants from all over the world expose their wares – not just those belonging to the common races but also more enterprising beastmen, like Goblin, Qiqirin, or even Mamool Ja.

To reach the alley is a short trip, into the Mizzenmast and down the Crow's Lift, then straight past the Octant, where Limsa's Aetheryte is located.

\columnbreak

<div class='descriptive' style="margin-top:5px">

In front of you is a small but crowded gallery that runs through the base of one of Limsa's many towers. The light of several oil lanterns is dim but more than enough after being reflected tenfold by the shiny surface of the metallic wares of its merchants: plates, kitchen appliances, but also jewels, diadems, armors, and weapons, all of different craft and quality.

The gallery near the Octant is but one of two, and its twin runs past a small plaza which also leads to the nearby piers, from which flocks of people come and go with all sorts of goods – most often than not fish that, as lominsans would well know, comes from the nearby fishermen guild.

Whereas the first gallery is where most utilities and tools are exposed, the second one houses the trade of raw food ingredients, be it flour milled from the nearby farms of Summerford or fresh seafood exposed by Qiqirn merchants.

</div>

\pagebreakNum

None of the business going around Hawker's Alley is particularly noteworthy. Most merchants sell everyday wares and consumables – the party can stock on potions, rations, and armors if they feel like.

Upon asking if anyone deals with ship enhancements or any form of ship protections, most just shake their heads, although…

<div class='descriptive'>

_Look, you haven't heard this from me, but the other day I've overheard a conversation at Fisherman's Bottom between two fellows in a back alley. One of the two was trying to sneak a small vessel out of Limsa in the middle of the night. The other said something about glamour magic or something like that. Maybe that might be your guy. I don't know, sounds fishy if you ask me._

</div>

The merchant could not see the two guys very well in the face, but he is pretty sure the dealer was a hyuran fellow that goes by the name of Jeff. As for the client, he caught glimpse of a very unique earring, shaped in the form of a Bomb, that protruded from what was clearly a Miqo'te ear.

#### Pursue Jeff

Asking around about Jeff reveals that he is a low-class swindler of sorts, yet people keep falling for his schemes so there must be some truth to what he claims he can do. He is known to hang around Fisherman's Bottom and is easy to recognize for having a pair of gills tattooed at both sides of his neck.

As expected, Jeff is easily found near the piers. How he reacts depends on the party's approach.

- He is wary when first being called by name.
- If the back-alley deal with the Miqo'te is mentioned, he unsheathes a knife and demands an explanation. The party will need to **Persuade** him (**DC 15**) or he will either attack or attempt to flee if overwhelmed.
- He opens up if the party simply states their business – however mentioning the Ironworks will cause him to be defensive again and will refuse to help the party.

He is a **Spy BR 402** and calls out two **Thugs BR 164** and one **Veteran BR 403** to his aid should things go awry.

If the party can get Jeff's cooperation, he leads them in a nearby alley, then into an isolated underground building down a short set of stairs.

<div class='descriptive'>

"_I know exactly what ye need._" the young Hyur says, as he rummages through a pile of assorted junk until he finally brings out what looks like a pendant shaped like a drop of water.

"_Behold the legendary Blessing of the Sea! This amulet alone can shield any vessel from any harm, even the fury of the mighty Leviathan itself! Yours for the very, very convenient price of 50'000 gils."_

</div>

It does not take an investigator's mind to smell the scam, but a superficial analysis (**Arcana 10,** or **Detect Magic**) confirms the amulet is no more magical than any street pebble, and a contested **Insight** check (against **1d20+2**) confirms that this is all a fraud.

The party can try to **Deceive** or **Intimidate** Jeff (**DC 15**) into actually giving them something valuable – if he has any. Upon success he lets go of the following:

<div class='descriptive'>

_Alright, alright, this was all a joke, a jest if you want. But I didn't make this thing up I swear! Not entirely, at least. I've heard the Sahagins possess a spell that goes under the same name, and that it does shit with the water or something. If you want to know more – Swiswix Gillytalx is your guy, he's a goblin merchant which often trades with the fishmen._

</div>

Jeff has not done any direct business with the Goblin, but he knows where he often sets up his shop (refer to the encounter with Swiswix).

> ##### Optional Encounter: Under Arrest!
> 
> If the party fails to extort information from Jeff, you can also play out this event as a backup. As the players leave the underground market, they are stopped by two Yellowjackets who just followed them.
> 
> The two guards count as **Knights BR 163** and are chasing Jeff after taking under custody the Miqo'te pirate (see the following section).
> 
> They call out Jeff for being under arrest, at which point he pleads to the party: "You! Help me get rid of these two bananas here and I'll tell you something useful!". The party can either:
> 
> * **Side with Jeff**: they are rewarded with the same intel from above.
> 
> * **Side with the Yellowjackets**: a fight against Jeff and the same group from above (the two **Thugs** and the **Veteran**) ensues. Upon victory, the yellowjackets agree to accompany the group to the Coral Tower, where the Miqo'te pirate is being held: proceed to its encounter.
> 
> * **Walk away**: Jeff is arrested, but the party does not get any extra intel.

#### Pursue the Miqo'te with the Bomb earring

A passerby saw a Miqo'te fitting the description being cuffed and escorted by the Yellowjackets earlier yesterday, therefore the best bet on where to find him would be to ask them directly at the Coral Tower.

<div class='descriptive'>

Once the headquarters for the Knights of the Barracuda, the Coral Tower has now become the operational base for the Yellowjackets, ever since their corps has separated and the Knights merged into the Maelstrom. The base is open to the public, as it hosts the Marauder guild.

</div>

\pagebreakNum

<img src="https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/63884/blubomb-3-1606991671.png" class="full-art" style="right:-20%;top:0%;height:100%"/>
<img src="https://watercolors.giantsoup.com/phb/phb_right/0001.png" class="stain"/>


A receptionist is welcoming anyone interested in joining the corps or the Marauders. If questioned about the Miqo'te, he reaches out to Lieutenant Fhilswys, a female Seawolf Roegadyn with short hair and a sidecut. She confirms having taken the Miqo'te into custody but will not discuss any further detail unless otherwise convinced (**Persuasion 18**, or a contested **Deception** against **1d20+5**). Attempting to Intimidate the Lieutenant or failing to Deceive her causes her to react aggressively and force the party out of the tower.

Alternatively, the party can state to be on official business, but the Lieutenant demands proof for it. Fortunately, Beatrix has an official employment contract with her, which will suffice.

Once finally convinced, Fhilswys finally fills in the party with more information.

- The guy is a certain A'dhewa Tia, a rogue pirate agent previously belonging to the Bloody Executioners, but no longer part of their crew.
- He tried to smuggle a cargo of assorted weapons in the dead of the night but failed to hide well. Apparently, he was convinced his vessel was invisible from outside.
- From the documents on board, it seemed like the weapons were destined to some middleman for the Garleans, probably to Castrum Centri in Mor Dhona.

That is all that they managed to extort him so far, but the party is free to interrogate him if they want.

A'dhewa is spending his time bored down in a cell within the lower grounds of the Coral Tower. He is a resigned guy who knows well that he will probably be sentenced to death for dealing with the Garleans. No amount of persuasion or intimidation will convince him to cooperate, since there is nothing in for him. But if the party is available for putting a good word for him, maybe he can be of help.

<div class='descriptive'>

_Ok here's the thing: that guy, Jeff? Total asshole. He gave me a magicked prism that was supposed to make my boat invisible. But I was not born yesterday, nuh-huh! So, I had him SHOW me it. And may Leviathan swallow me whole that stupid triangle did make my boat disappear. It was visible only when onboard but not from outside._

_Yet here I am, waiting for one of those walking fucking pineapples to decorate my head with a bullet. I bet the bastard gave me a fake and kept the real thing for him. But you know what? He also told me something. All those enchantments in his wares come from stuff stolen from the Coral Tridents. Now I'm not one to suggest you consort with the fishmen, but you could do worse than ask for a certain Swiswix Gillytalx. He is known to peddle with the Sahagins, but may Llymlaen take me now if I have any idea of how._

</div>

From there the party can easily ask around and be directed towards Swiswix's usual hotspot.

### The Drowning Wench

As the leader of the ironworks, H'naanza knows just the person.

<div class='descriptive'>

_That drunkard moron, Brithael, I haven't seen him today. He must be drowning himself at the Wench. The bastard likes his ale too much but knows how to do a job – if you can sober him up, that is._

</div>

The Drowning Wench is not far from the ironworks – in fact, the party is very likely to have passed by there at a certain point. It is located at the middle level of the Mizzenmast, below the Admiral's Deck and not far from the Aftcastle.

As stories would have it, the Drowning Wench is ironically named after the mother of the proprietor, Baderon Tenfingers, even though it is far more likely to be just plain and playful slander on behalf of its patrons. 

It is a large circular hall within the Mizzenmast, whose wooden floor recalls the deck of Limsa's finest vessels. Its stony walls create a unique acoustic within it which adds a very specific tone to the performance of itinerant bards, who so often make of it their theater – at the risk of encountering a too riotous band of pirates on a wrong day, that is.

When asking the bartender, Baderon, about the second-in-command of Naldiq & Vymelli's, he makes a hint towards a wasted young Hyur who is soundly sleeping on a nearby table. 

<div class='descriptive'>

"_Been like that e'er since late yesternight. Love the man an 'is work, but he just got too much of my own specialty, the Bloody Finger."_

</div>

No matter the party's effort, Brithael is completely gone. No amount of calling, slapping, or straight-up shoving to the ground makes any good. 

*[Screenshot source](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Limsa_Lominsa/Legacy)*

\columnbreak

<div class='descriptive' style="margin-top:5px">

_"That's a Bloody hangover for ya. Nay, if ye want our pal up and running ye've gotta give him a Tenfinger Slap."_

</div>

The Tenfinger Slap is yet another of Baderon's specialties, the ultimate sober-up (or at least so he claims). He has got in stock some of the ingredients, but he needs the party for some others who he is missing.

- a can of "chocobo milk",
- a Pyro Pepper,
- and the secret ingredient: a Gysahl Pickle.

#### Fetching the "Chocobo Milk"

As any person who has ever seen the yellow-feathered birds in their life, chocobos do not produce milk. The name of "Chocobo Milk" is actually attributed to a peculiar mixture of Buffalo Milk and fresh Chocobo eggs, whose exact recipe is known only to the farmers of Summerford.

Thankfully the drink is common enough in Limsa and can be purchased at Hawker's Alley for just 10 gil per cup.

#### Fetching the Pyro Pepper

Infamously named after the fire-aligned voidsent, this particular variety of chili pepper has a natural tendency to accrue fire aspected aether inside itself during maturation, which then erupts in a small explosion when fully matured, which causes the seeds to spread around.

Cultivation is tricky, as the pepper's berry must be harvested as late as possible to obtain the best spiciness from the accumulated aether, but not too late as the berries might become unstable and suddenly explode while stocked or being transported, causing an unpleasant chain reaction.

Stock is already scarce as it is, due to its nature, but it seems that some weird folk has bought all that was left and is now running an "all you can eat" challenge daring but the bravest adventurer to swallow as many as they possibly can… He will concede a small bag from his reserve, but only if somebody agrees to participate.

\pagebreakNum

The entry fee is 50 gils. Have the contender run a Constitution saving throw each time they eat a pepper: the difficulty increases progressively at steps of 5 until a maximum of 25. Roll the save with advantage if they take precautions that grant them resistance to fire. If at any point the throw fails, the pepper explodes in their mouth causing minor burns and a sore throat – no damage taken, but the contender will have to retire.

Depending on the number of peppers successfully gulped down, the reward changes accordingly:

| **Pepper Number** | **Save** | **Reward** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | 5 | Nothing |
| **2** | 10 | 50 gils (entry fee) |
| **3** | 15 | 200 gils |
| **4** | 20 | 500 gils and a lousy shirt\* |
| **5** | 25 | 1000 gils, a lousy shirt\* and a bomb earring\*\* |

\*The lousy shirt has the picture of a Bomb monster and the caption "I'm on fire!" on it.

\*\*The bomb earring is sculpted in the image of a Bomb monster and grants resistance to Fire damage when attuned to.

No matter the outcome, the party still obtains a small bag containing ten pyro peppers as agreed with the game's host.

#### Fetching the Gysahl Pickle

Few foods are for questionable tastes like the foul-smelling Gysahl Pickles. Initially invented by accident when a Chocobo breeder forgot his stock of Gysahl greens to rot in a jar of oil for over three months, their smell is so distinct that gate guards can spot an incoming carriage from a malm away – and they often let it pass no questions asked, as long as the owner takes their rotting stench away. Yet, despite their infamy, some _connoisseurs_ consider it, I quote, "_An acquired taste"_.

Given the scarce demand, there is not a lot of availability. However, one particular Goblin – yours truly Swiswix Gillytalx – seems particularly fond of them. The party can find Swiswix setting up shop at his usual spot – refer to Swiswix's encounter for a better description.

He is particularly avid of his _precious_ pickles and will not let go of them easily. He will, however, concede one if the group helps him with a little errand. All they need to do is deliver a sack of clams down at Fisherman's Bottom: the client is a man that has a small workshop near the Fishermen's Guild.

While _en route_, a young Miqo'te bumps into whoever carries the sack… Which immediately after is gone. As the party chases the thief, they are led into the back alleys of Limsa, where a group of six **Thugs**  **BR 164** awaits them for an ambush.

\columnbreak

<div class='descriptive' style="margin-top:5px">

_Lookie lookie what we've 'ere… I fear ye've stumbled in the wrong alley pal. I would turn me tail and just let go if I were ye. It's just not worth the effort or risking yer life, ye know?_

</div>

The group can try to parley (**Persuasion 25**) or menace (**Intimidation 25**) the thief, but it will not be simple, given the numerical inferiority. If the party decides to fight back, they can attempt to convince the thief leader again during the fight: lower the difficulty by 5 points for every two Thugs defeated (minimum **10**).

No matter the approach, either soon after the fight starts or before the party leaves six other **Thugs** make a theatrical appearance from the shadows, but they are on the party's side and target the seafood thieves instead.

> ##### The Rogues Guild
> 
> Originally stemming from a pirate organization known as "The Upright Thieves", these paladins of the shadows enforce an unspoken "code of criminals", which is a series of rules put in place to protect fellow lominsans from petty thievery and other unlawful acts. Their headquarters are located near the city's docks, under the façade of the convent of the Dutiful Sisters of the Edelweiss. See **EE1 104**.

As it turns out, the newcomers belong to the Rogues Guild and have been tailing the Miqo'te and his accolades for a little while. As the Rogues emerge from the shadow, a short debate ensues.

<div class='descriptive' style="margin-top:5px">

A young Hyur woman suddenly appears apparently from nowhere, two daggers in hand, pointing at the Miqo'te.

_S'nahza my friend! What goes on here? Stealing to a fellow lominsan, are we?_

S'nahza looks to be quite nervous about the appearance of the new guests.

_These men are no lominsans! Nor is the goblin they work for. This is rightfully earned loot!_

The Hyur woman doesn't flinch and instead smirks at the Miqo'te.

_In there you err brother. See, little Swiswix has all right to trade in our beautiful city, and the Code doesn't allow to steal from an honest trader. Me and my… Sisters, here, can't let you have it your way._

S'nahza is clearly furious.

_Honest trader my ass, he deals with the fishmen and you know it! Now get lost!_

</div>

Whether the thieves are defeated or surrender, the Rogues tie their hands and hold them captive. The Hyur woman who seems to be in charge returns the sack of clams to the party. 

<div class='descriptive'>

"_Thanks for your help friends, here's what's yours take. Be careful, these are not regular clams."_. 

</div>

She then departs, without any further comment.

Back on track, the party can finally reach their destination: inside is what looks like a goldsmith shop, teeming with precision machinery, lenses, and bits and bobs of broken jewelry all over the place.

The owner, a brown-haired middle-aged Hyur is more than happy to receive his goods.

<div class='descriptive'>

_Ah, Swiswix sends you, right? I hope you had no troubles on your way._

As he says that, he picks a hand knife from his pocket, and forces one of the clams open, revealing a pearl inside.

_These are the finest pearl in all Vylbrand, you see. Only the Sahagins know where to look for. I don't mind buying from them, but it's usually Swiswix who is the middleman. I trust his judgment, as much as a queer fellow he looks like._

</div>

The Hyur man gives the party a receipt note, which they can finally return to Swiswix in exchange for the prized pickle.

\columnbreak

#### Wakey wakey!

Now that all ingredients are gathered, Baderon can finish the Tenfinger Slap.

<div class='descriptive'>

You observe the bartender as he puts the most improbable ingredients inside a small pot. He waters the mixture with the Chocobo Milk, then puts insides the Pyro Pepper, which results in the compound to suddenly boil.

He then throws in large chunks of ice to stop it from going over the borders and puts everything into what looks like a cocktail mixer, which he shakes vigorously. Finally, he cuts the rotting Gysahl Pickle into small pieces, and toss them in the mix like that.

_Here. Have him swallow this whole. And pinch his nose. I suggest you do the same: it doesn't smell pretty._

You have no idea what sort of witch's potion Baderon has just concocted. From the look of it, it resembles Chocobo vomit on a bad day and smells at least twice as bad. It looks like it's boiling on the surface, yet it's freezing cold to the touch.

As expected Baderon doesn't… like that. At first, he doesn't even seem to notice it, but once he gulps the last drop… He suddenly opens his eyes and starts screaming alarmed: "_WATER! WATER PLEASE!"_. You hand him over a cup, but he spits the content immediately after: "_Oh god, why does it make it worse?! What the hell was that?!"_

</div>

It takes a while before he calms down, but at least he is completely woken up. As the party states their intent, he thinks about it for a little bit.

<div class='descriptive'>

_A way to shield a ship to reach the Isles of Umbra you say? Why didn't that moron H'naanza think about it earlier…? Ugh… well, I'm not sure of any mechanical protection that could help you, but… I've heard the Sahagins often travel to the Isles on their own. For what reason, beats me._

_If you want to meddle with the fishmen you'd better check with someone who's a regular among them. Have you met Swiswix Gillytalx, the goblin merchant?_

### Mealvaan's Gate

As any respectful researcher, Sebeku suggests a more academic approach.

<div class='descriptive'>

_If you need to shield yourself against the elements, I could not honestly think of a better place than Mealvaan's Gate for your inquiries. The respectable academy of the Arcanists is house to the brightest minds of Limsa Lominsa: surely, they will be able to assist you in your endeavors._

</div>

Housed between the Ferry Docks and the West Hawkers' Halley, Mealvaan's Gate is the city's inspectorate for imported goods. In an environment ruled by calculations and obscure formulas for deriving the taxes of inbound products, the arcane art of arcanima was born. Its students are well versed in the esoteric usage of calculus and geometry, which through precise use of incantations and aetherically conductive inks can conjure the most disparate magical effect, none the last the summoning of Carbuncles, magical pets who abide by the arcanist's will.

The moment the party starts inquiring about their mission and the need to shield themselves against the elements, they find themselves dragged by a tall, imposing Rogedayn woman:

<div class='descriptive'>

_Oh yes yes yes, you are perfect my dear! Come, come with aunt Syhrrael, I have just the thing for you!_

</div>

Syhrrael is an arcanist researcher in her mid-thirties. Sporting a towering height of 7.2 feet, her clothes are a collection of countless patches, bruises, and burnt marks. Her impressive arcanima book is as large as her torso and strapped to her back in the guise of a backpack.

Before the party has any chance to fight back, they find themselves in the arcanist's "laboratory", a large circular and clear area, almost like some kind of arena.

<div class='descriptive'>

_So! Let me explain. You are in search of protection against lightning, yes? Well, what you know, it is precisely my field of research! Now if you would just help me out with some little experiment of mine…_

</div>

*[Screenshot source](https://twitter.com/roefizzlebeef/status/1049135167128985600)*

\pagebreakNum

#### Experiment 1 – Shocking Runes

Syhrrael takes her grimoire from her back and a quill from one of her pockets. As she swiftly moves her hand over the overly written pages of her spell book, several markings make their appearance on the floor, twenty in total.

She explains that out of all the runes, nineteen are shock traps that deal damage upon entering them, while only one is safe – roll 1d20 to decide which one it is. She asks for a volunteer to step on a glyph she traced on the ground.

<div class='descriptive'>

_Let me explain! This glyph is what I am developing, just standing on it should heighten your senses and help you perceive the aether around you! Does it not? Now! Focus your perception, try to detect the safe rune, make your choice!_

</div>

Once the volunteer has decided, Syhrrael snaps her finger, at which point eighteen runes – bar the one which was selected and the safe one – are activated, and a jolt of lightning strikes down on them.

Now that all but two runes remain, and only one is safe, the volunteer is given the option to change their choice or not. After that, as part of the experiment, they need to bet on their choice and step on the desired rune… And either be welcomed by a shocking surprise (**1d4** lighting damage) or a sigh of relief.

> ##### Note for the Narrator
> While this appears to be a game of chances, it really is not. In fact, no matter the player's first choice, they have a 95% chance of stepping on the right rune if they switch their choices, and a flimsy 5% should they not. Albeit this seems counter-intuitive, you should check the fascinating [Monty-Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

#### Experiment 2 – Lightning Search

A volunteer is once again called, and they are shown sixteen illusory, distorted figures, disposed on a line.

<div class='descriptive'>

_Now for a game of numbers! Each of these illusions conceals a number between zero and ninety-nine. They are disposed in increasing order, but I can't tell you which one is which. You must find number fifty, which is among them, but you only have eight attempts, otherwise… BZZZ!_

</div>

Choose 16 random numbers between 0 and 100, which must include number 50, and put them in increasing order. Ask the player to guess where the number 50 is, and each time they make a guess reveal the number beneath. When an illusion is revealed, the glyph below them starts accruing energy. If they make eight mistakes, they are dealt yet another shock (**1d4** lightning damage) and the experiment ends.

\columnbreak

> ##### Note for the Narrator
> The lowest number of attempts required in the worst case is 5, following a procedure called a [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm): test a number, if lower than the target try again with the higher half, if higher than the target try with the lower half… again and again. If you want to really test your players' wits and not their luck, feel free to lower the number of attempts. Maybe just make it 5 if a programmer is among them, just saying.

#### Experiment 3 – Lightning Dots

As Syhrrael jolts down more notes, she again calls another volunteer. This time an illusion of nine dots, on a three-by-three grid appears.

<div class='descriptive'>

_Finally, for a more geometrical test! Here are nine dots. You must connect all nine dots by tracing four straight lines – but here's the catch: each line must start where the last one ended. You have five minutes, go go go!_

</div>

This is a classic nine-dots puzzle. The key to the solution is to not constrain the lines "inside" the 3x3 square but to extend them outside. There are several solutions to the problem, but here is an example.

<div>
<img src='https://i.postimg.cc/wvjgQ69D/Ninedots.png' class=puzzle-handout>

<a href="https://www.materialsforengineering.co.uk/engineers-puzzle/the-9-dot-puzzle/49412/1/" target="_blank"> *Source* </a>

</div>

If the player can't figure it out within the time limit, again, they receive a lightning shock of 1d4 damage.

\pagebreakNum

#### That's enough for today!

Syhrrael thanks the players for their assistance, then she performs some adjustments to the experimental glyph. She then grabs a scroll nearby dutifully copying the geometrical pattern.

<div class='descriptive'>

_There there, that should do it… here! Take! Inscribe this on any armor and rest assured that you won't have to worry about any lightning whatsoever!_

…_What? Ships? Oh no no no, this is for living, sentient beings to use. If you want to protect a ship… Uhm… Well, I don't know much about traversing the sea, but I've heard of a Goblin peddler who deals with the Sahagins. Maybe you have better chances with him. The name's Swiswix, you are sure to find him at his usual spot at the Anchor Yard._

</div>

For all their troubles the party gets a scroll of **Protection from Energy (BR 270)** and a hint on where to go next.

# PART II
##### The Blessing of the Sea

</div>

<div style="margin-top:120%"></div>

# The goblin merchant

Few creatures are as industrious and adaptable as the Goblins. The same holds true for little Swiswix Gillytalx, a jack-of-all-trades who often sets his shop at the Anchor Yard. While he avoids saying that aloud, it is well known that Swiswix's primary source are the Sahagins of Western La Noscea, although it is not clear how he manages to come back in one piece from each of his trips, nor why the lominsan government is allowing him to set trade in favor of the thalassocracy's fiercest enemy.

<div class='descriptive'>

There used to be a time when the largest galleons of Limsa Lominsa would lower their anchors in this very corner of the city, yet this is no longer custom after some tremendous gales two hundred years ago made the area unfit for docking.

Taking its name from its previous purpose, the Anchor Yard is a small courtyard in the upper part of the city. At its center lies the statue of a seagull readying his wings, ever staring at the sea, yet forever bound in its plastic pose.

As you get near you spot few small groups of pirates squabbling here and there about the most futile topics, but the most curious sight is that of a small goblin, sitting at the very border of the courtyard, his large backpack right at his side. In front of him is a stool with assorted goods, mostly bounty of the sea: urchins, seashells, odd jewels crafted from coral, even some fresh (and smelly) fish here and there. He sits in front of a large number of crates who are likely to be its larger "stock".

As you approach him, the goblin stands up, trembling with anticipation. "_Oh! Is that moneybringers that Swiswix sees? Come come! Come friends! Swiswix has all that uplander wishes for! And shinyrocks and tastyfish and more!"_

Despite his clumsy (some even say cute) appearance, Swiswix is a clever merchant who is inclined to bartering. He often interrupts his clients trying to propose some of his most exotic (and expensive) wares. Check the table beside to see his stock.

Once the party finally manages to inquire Swiswix about their problem, he comments thus:

<div class='descriptive'>

_Uhm yes yes, Swiswix oftentalks busydeals with menfish. But not scary menfish, no-no. Swiswix is friendlyfriend with Novv. He's good manfish, not Coral Tridents._

_Uplanders want to safemake to island of old shinyhouse, yes? If uplanders give jinglyshines to Swiswix, Swiswix brings uplander to Novv! Cubfish of Novv oftengo to shinyhouse, good fish there. Novv must have hiddenthought to avoid shinywind of island!_

</div>

In case your gobbiespeak isn't that good (may I suggest [brushing up](https://sourceful.us/doc/723/ffxiv-gobbiespeak-spreadlist-for-uplander-learnyti)?) Swiswix is offering to accompany the party to Clutchfather Novv, a friendly and collaborative Sahagin leader in Western La Noscea. In exchange for his aid, all he wants is ~~updlanders' jinglyshines~~ a fair share of money. He lends different degrees of help depending on the party's proposal.

Once reached an agreement, Swiswix gives the party appointment to Aleport in a week.

| Item | Qty. | Cost (each) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rations (dry stock fish, 1 day) | 20 | 50 |
| Potion of water breathing | 3 | 12'000 |
| Raw aquamarine\* | 1 | 25'000 |
| Trident of fish command **(BR 209)** \*\* | 1 | 50'000 |
| Blinkyrock (?) \*\*\* | 1 | 25'000 |

\* Can be refined into an actual Aquamarine worth 50'000 gils by a skilled Goldsmith, under payment of 10'000 gils

\*\* Stolen from the Coral Tridents tribe, this weapon is often used by Sahagins to gain the favor of their favorite sea steed, the Elbst.

\*\*\* A weirdly shaped, thin, and weakly glowing stone tablet, as big as an adult Hyur's hand. A player passing a **DC 18 Intelligence (History/Arcana)** check identifies it as an Allagan Tomestone of unknown content.

> ##### Upgraded Aether Syphon
> 
> The Allagan Tomestone can be brought to the attention of Sebeku, who is very eager to study it. Given a few days, he can decipher its contents: an Allagan essay on aetherology and the aetherial balance of "enlightened" species.
> 
> With the newly acquired knowledge, he can refine his Aetherial Syphon into an upgraded version. Please refer to the chapter about entering Pharos Sirius for further details.

<div class='wide'>

| **Cost** | **Help granted** | **Details** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1'000** | Simple busydeal\* | Swiswix will accompany the party to Novv, introduce them, and then will be back on his own. |
| **5'000** | Friendlyfriend | Will accompany the party until they're done dealing with Novv, but not in dangerous territory. Until then, he will offer the following services: 
| | | Free daily rations (up to 3 days)
| | | Discounted Healing Potions (4'500 gils each, max 5) |
| | | He will carry the party's extra weight, up to 100 pounds. |
| **20'000** | Gobbiebuddy | Will accompany the party for the entirety of their mission, even in dangerous territory. Will offer all the services above, with the following upgrades: 
| | | Free daily rations (up to 6 days)
| | | Heavily discounted Healing Potions (4'000 gils each, max 10)
| | | Will offer to buy the party's loot at 10% extra their market value (up to 50'000 gils in surplus). |

\*If the party cannot afford at least the basic sum, H'naanza offers to pay up the goblin services on behalf of Naldiq & Vymelli's.

## The Road to Aleport

The harbor of Aleport is located in Western La Noscea, which can be reached by either of two routes:

| **Route** | **Cost (per passenger)** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **By Land** | 5 gil | 3 days |
| **By ferry** | 20 gil | 1 day |

The first route can be crossed by either renting Chocobos or by requesting passage via carriage. It goes from Limsa's Zephyr Gate into Middle La Noscea, north through Zephyr Drift and then Summerford. Due to the existence of the Descent, large carriages are forbidden to pass through, as the Skylift can only accommodate smaller vehicles (up to 4 persons). Whatever the case the lift cannot operate with a loaded carriage and requires a series of lengthy maneuvers to bring everyone (chocobos, driver, and passengers) down to the northern area.

The second half of the journey is relatively smooth due to the leveled terrain: the road leads north into Western La Noscea, passing by the settlement of Swiftperch and finally into Skull Valley, where Aleport is located, right after crossing a narrow patch of land that connects it to Quarterstone.

Going through the sea, instead, is a much simpler ride, one which does not pass by any impervious or dangerous area. The sea route does however pass to the east of the Isles of Umbra: while the ferry keeps well at distance from its waters, there is plenty of time to observe it at a distance, either by naked eye or spyglass.

You can exploit both occasions for a more relaxed interaction between party members: for example, you can give them a chance to know Beatrix better (she will spend the better part of the voyage plucking at harp). Alternatively, if your group is the more action-oriented type you can improvise an attack by bandits or rogue pirates, like the Serpent Reavers.

## Fishes 'n Goblins

Little Swiswix is spending his time waiting for the group at Aleport's tavern, gulping mug after mug of the eponymous drink.

<div class='descriptive'>

You have some trouble locating the little goblin, which you eventually realize to be the center of a very curious crowd. He is sitting, perfectly fine, at one corner of a small table somewhere near the center of the tavern, surrounded by dozens of empty mugs which no human being should be able to bear – let alone a small creature like Swiswix.

On the other side sits a tall rugged Roegadyn man, wearing a bandana, who can hardly keep his head high after the ten-something empty cups in front of him. The crowd is debating and making bets, until eventually, the Roegadyn collapses on the table, trashing several glasses on his way. The crowd suddenly snaps, half cheering, the other half cursing every deity known in Eorzea and beyond.

_Pshkooooh! Uplander must be addlebrained if he thinks he can beat Swiswix at game of burn drinking! Upbring more grainwater to Swiswix!_

</div>

After drinking all that ale Swiswix is a bit tipsy, but not as much wasted as anyone would expect. Once the party is ready, he leads them on to the west of Aleport and suggests leaving the Chocobos behind.

Once reached Camp Skull valley, right before the South Tidegate which leads into the Sahagin territory, Swiswix points out a very narrow passage that goes downward, skirting alongside the reef. The passage allows to bypass the Coral Tridents territory entirely and stay undetected but is wide enough for just one person to pass, it is unprotected and very steep.

\pagebreakNum

<div class="wide">

## Novv's Nursery

<a href="https://i.postimg.cc/Sxb4tLyS/Novv-Nursery.webp">
<img class="map" src="https://i.postimg.cc/Sxb4tLyS/Novv-Nursery.webp" />
</a>

</div>

After ten minutes traversing the passage, the group gets to Novv's Nursery from the southern side. There a young Sahagin stands guard, blocking anyone who happens to know about the hidden route.

<div class='descriptive'>

_Pshhh… You are back, goblin merchant. Who are these shhhorewalkers who you bring?_

</div>

Like the rest of his brethren, the guard has white scales and bright red fins – contrary to the primal-corrupted Sahagins of the Coral Tridents, who have dark blue scales and dark red fins, with shades of indigo of varying degrees. The guard is wary towards the group but trusting towards Swiswix and will not attack unless menaced or otherwise provoked. Right after entering the Nursery, the following scene unfolds.

<div class='descriptive'>

You notice two young Sahagin spawnlings, the oldest as tall as Swiswix, rushing towards you. You see the tallest one approaching Swiswix.

_You're back! You're back! What brings you, floppy earssss?_

</div>

\columnbreak

<div class='descriptive' style="margin-top:10px">

The goblin emits a short grunt which might be interpreted as a suffocated laugh, as he gets closer.

_Well well, Swiswix's favorite fishkids! Have Kihp and Kohp been good froglings?_

The two younglings protest, mildly annoyed.

_Sssahagin! Sssahagin Sssswiswix! Not tadpoles!_

This time you can hear genuine, acute laughter coming from beneath Swiswix's mask.

_Yes yes, mighty Sahagin froglings! Then, Swiswix brings present for great fish warriors of comingtimes!_

You see Swiswix dropping his backpack and starting rummaging inside. After a while, he extracts what looks like two wooden toys in the shape of an Elbst. Without hesitation, the kids immediately snatch their gift, cheering at the goblin trader.

</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div class="descriptive">

_You ssspeak funny floppy ears, but you're our favorite ssshorewalker!_

The two overjoyed Sahagin kids don't waste a minute and instantly turn their tails to play with their new toys.

_Kihp and Kohp are Swiswix's friendlyfriends, like all menfish of Novv. Uplander be good with family of Novv, yes? Family of Novv is family of Swiswix._

</div>

### Meeting with Novv

After being requested an audience, Clutchfather Novv agrees to meet the party.

> ##### The Scarlet Sea Devil
> 
> The Clutchfather's rank is mostly shown by his garments: he dons more elaborate jewels compared to his children, and bright red sashes the same color of his fins. He is a gentle and calm pacifist leader in his late thirties now, but in his youth, he was known as the "Scarlet Sea Devil", the fiercest and most ruthless of the Sahagin warriors. He has ever since resigned from his title and changed lifestyle after much of his clutch was struck down by the Lominsan navy in a retaliatory attack. See **EE1 252**.

Novv disposition towards the party is welcoming and diplomatic. After listening to their pleas, he goes into his thoughts, unsure how to approach the situation.

<div class='descriptive'>

_Perhapsss... There might be a way to help you. Yesss, it is true we ride our Elbssst to the Isles. But I cannot let a ssstranger privy to our sssecrets. Prove yourssself our ally and I shhhall lend you aid._

</div>

Before the party's arrival, Novv's Nursery was raided in the night by the Coral Tridents. During the raid five of the youngest of Novv's children were kidnapped (…fishnapped?). Worst of all a batch of eggs, close to hatching, was taken as well. The Clutchfather fears the Coral Tridents intend to summon Leviathan again, and that they might sacrifice his children as an offering to the serpent god.

<div class='descriptive'>

_I cannot ssstress enough how important are my children to me and their brothersss, I cannot allow losssing any of them. Bring them back shhhorewalkers, and you will have my trussst and eternal gratitude._

</div>

\columnbreak

### Exploring the Nursery

Before heading for their rescue mission, the party is welcome to stay and explore the Nursery. It is a small territory the one that the Clutchfather has kept for himself and his own, but one they hold dear. On average, the youngest children (the few who were spared are between 7 and 10 years old) are curious or playful towards the party, while the "oldest" (11 to 15 years old) are either indifferent or wary of them. The clutch is composed entirely of males: female Sahagins are very rare (on average, one is born every ten males), and when that happens, she is immediately sent to the Matriarch's palace, to be groomed as the next queen candidate.

Independently of how Swiswix was employed, he decides to stay around for a while. If asked to, he agrees to help the party in trading with the clutch members, which improves their disposition towards them. Beatrix can employ her diplomatic skills as well to help with the most stubborn types. During her interaction with one of Novv's children, he remarks how she "_smells different of other shhhorewalkers, but how ssso I cannot explain_".

#### Fish Trader - Seph

This young Sahagin is Swiswix's best friend and the best fisher of Novv's clutch. He can sell the party raw food and pearls.

#### Elbst Trainer - Keeh

He is the local expert in terms of water rides. He can instruct the party on what an Elbst is, and can offer to rent one if the party is authorized by Novv. He also knows of a route that can lead to the Serpent's Tongue.

### Side Quest: Kihp and Kohp's secret spot

While on their way to Keeh, the party spots Kihp and Kohp, the two Sahagin kids from before, pestering him with questions about Elbsts. In particular, they seem curious about their weak points and how could one – hypothetical – young Sahagin possibly chase a – even more hypothetical – big one away.

The Elbst master dismisses them quickly, claiming that he has no time to play with them. Disappointed, the two younglings leave for the coast, but not before giving a glance at the adventurers. If the players desire so, they can approach them to start a small side quest.

<div class='descriptive'>

_Sssshorewalkers want to help? You are friends with floppy ears, so you must be good ssshorewalkers! But you must swear to never tell our brothersss – it's our big secret, only for us! And, well, friendly ssshorewalkers._

</div>

The two spawnlings have a secret "hideout" in a cave not far from the Nursery. However, a few days ago, a large Elbst decided that that was going to be its new nest, and thus evicted them out. If the party can kill, or chase away the Elbst Kihp promises them one of their treasures – a "shiny rock" they found ashore some time ago.

\pagebreakNum

#### The Hideout

Kihp and Kohp lead the party along the coastline, until, eventually, they reach a cove that stretches inside a cave formation. The entrance to their hideout is right after a creak in a rocky wall just in front of them. However, the largest Elbst they have ever seen is now taking a nap in front of it, blocking the access.

With some observation (**DC 15 Perception**) it is possible to notice some droplets of water dripping on top of the Elbst. The ceiling of the cave appears fractured right in front of the entrance and can be destroyed by dealing enough damage to it (consider a resistance of 10 hit points). If that happens, the ceiling collapses on the Elbst which, scared, barely manages to escape and runs for its life under the sea. Much to the children's delight this also creates a timid waterfall which now acts as a natural obfuscation to their hideout.

Alternatively, the party can inquiry Keeh about Elbst biology. Mildly annoyed, he explains that while most of their body is covered in scales, the tip of their tail is not, and it's also incredibly sensible. A well-aimed attack should be enough to scare one for good.

Lacking both pieces of information, direct assault is always an option. Check the monster block for the Alpha Elbst for details on the encounter.

#### Conclusion

After their hideout is reclaimed, Kihp and Kohp invite the party inside and name them "honorary members of the _clutch brigade_", as they like to call themselves. In celebration of their success, they gift them a small white rock, not larger than a thumb. Despite being inactive, a person expert enough in aetherology ( **DC 20 Arcana** ) realizes it's a shard of auracite. While the whole stone is incredibly dangerous and has fallen into legend for twisting its owners in both mind and body, this small fragment appears harmless, while still having some degree of affinity with nearby aether.

> ##### Another Upgrade for the Syphon
> 
> Like the Allagan Tomestone, the Auracite fragment can be used to produce a higher quality Aetherial Syphon, that extends its properties to the surroundings rather than being focused on its owner. Refer to the chapter about Pharos Sirius for more details on the upgrade and its effects.

</a>

</div>

The Coral Tridents' hideout, the Sapsa Spawning Grounds, is located just north of Novv's Nursery, but the road to its entrance is teeming with hostile Sahagins occupied in a perpetual skirmish with the Maelstrom troops at the North and South Tidegate. Rushing headlong is sure to rise every alarm and send swarms of angry and armed Sahagins to the party's way. Preliminary investigation can provide valuable intel on the matter:

- The Tridents are very aggressive and try to lead an attack towards the Tidegates almost every day. During the attacks there are fewer guards stationed at the entrance, so the party can try to sneak by.
- Sahagins do not stand the night watch. Instead, this duty is delegated to the Serpent Reavers, a band of tempered ("drowned") pirates under the influence of Leviathan. Unable to cover both fronts, the rear of their cove (The Serpent's Tongue) is relatively unguarded and reachable by Elbst. The party can sneak into the Spawning Grounds at that time through that passage.
- Serpent Reavers are constantly harvesting water crystals around the Sahagin Landbase. Potentially, it would be possible for some of the party members to disguise themselves as one of them and enter the Spawning Grounds undetected.

### A1 – The Serpent's Tongue

Serpent Reavers are prowling this area, for a total of **4 Thugs BR 164** and **2 Veterans BR 403** , thus distributed:

- One thug is guarding a cage where one of Novv's children is held captive.
- One thug is keeping watch for incoming vessels approaching from the coastline. He can potentially spot medium creatures up to 1'000 ft. away through a spyglass.
- One thug is making rounds ensuring that there are no troubles.
- One thug and one veteran are standing guard at the entrance of a small building, the Reavers' headquarters.
- One veteran is guarding the land entrance to the Serpent's Tongue.

Four additional thugs are resting in the building and will come out in pairs of two if they are alarmed.

At nighttime, the Reavers are thus repositioned.

- Both Veterans moved to Sapsa's entrance.
- Two thugs moved inside the building.
- Only two thugs are in the area, both drinking in front of a campfire.
- The cage and the building are unguarded.

The thugs are inebriated: they have disadvantage on perception checks for detecting an infiltrating party. They also have disadvantage on attack rolls should they enter a fight.

#### Serpent Reavers' Headquarters

As for the building itself, it is a small construction with a single room that expands underground. The entrance is void of ornaments and contains only two tables and some barrels of ale stacked near the walls. A short staircase leads underground where three more rooms are accessible from a cross-shaped crossing: two bedrooms to the sides and a larger meeting room to the front end.

The bedrooms have nothing more than improvised straw mattresses, a few emptied bottles of ale, and a bunch of common weapons (daggers, axes, and longswords). Two Potions of Healing can be spotted amidst the dirt with a **DC 12 Perception** check.

The meeting room has more furniture to it: a large table stands in the middle, where a map of all La Noscea is unrolled. From the entrance, two torches emit a dim light, while two battle axes are walled on top of it in a crossed fashion. On the northern wall, there is an old, damp, and barely readable parchment, with a [prayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhZiZf0M-hQ) to Leviathan inscribed on it:

### A2 – Axolotl Farm

Three malnourished axolotls (**Large Eft FFWC 48**) are roaming about, contained within a rudimentary fence built with processed coral and special resilient seaweeds. They are aggressive but mostly due to hunger: before attacking they stand idle, wary, sniffing for food that the adventurers might carry.

The axolotls can be tamed with a **DC 15 Animal Handling** check by offering them something to eat. The check is lowered to **10** if offered one of the fishes from the barrels in area 3. Alternatively, the fence can be made open while the party stays out of sight, causing the axolotls to rush towards Area 3 straight to the fish barrels, stomping the guards in the process. A sated axolotl is neutral towards strangers and can be tamed with a **DC 12 Animal Handling** check.

Tamed axolotls obey simple commands from the tamer, like "go there" and "jolt that". They can use the electricity in their bodies to attack enemies or objects. Jolted ballistae in Area 4 become inoperable and start emitting smoke, arousing suspicion.

### A3 – Food Storage

A few barrels and fishing tools are left lying around in this small grotto. The barrels contain stocks of fishes of various types, suggesting that the area is usually a deposit for the Sahagin's fishers to bring the fruit of their work. However, they have been moved to make space for a large makeshift cage which is present in the area, where two of Novv's children are being held. The cage is guarded by two Sahagin guards, a **Shelftooth** and a **Shelfscale**. The former holds a seashell horn and will fire an alarm as soon as he spots the adventurers.

When that happens, they are joined by two **Shelfclaw** sahagins after 1d4 turns coming south, and by a **Selfspine** sahagin two turns after them coming north. Furthermore, four **Shelfclaw** sahagins will arm the ballistae and barricade the area in front of A4, preventing access to A6.

Once the guards are dispatched, both children thank the party, but one insists on following them in their foray: he saw his closest brother taken away in a separate cell, along with crates containing eggs, and wants to ascertain his whereabouts.

> ##### Operating Whelk Ballistae
> 
> Ballistae can be mounted or dismounted as an action or movement. While on a ballista, the operator cannot use its movement speed: instead, it can use a movement action to move the ballista by 10 ft., and optionally an action to move it an extra 10 ft.
> 
> As an action, an operator can man the ballista in one of two ways:
> 
> - **Thunder Spear**. Ranged attack, one target within 60 ft. (120 ft.). On a hit, the target suffers 2d12 lightning damage.
> - **Thunder Roar**. _**Recharge (5-6)**__._ Choose a point within 60 ft. Each creature on a 15 ft. radius must roll a **Dexterity** saving throw against the operator's ranged attack modifier + 10, and suffer 4d8 lightning damage on a failure, or half as much on success.
> 
> Sahagins from Sapsa's Spawning Ground have proficiency in manning the ballistae, other characters lacking training do not.
> 
> A character who is operating a ballista has half-cover if targeted from the front. The shell on the back of the seat obscures the driver, granting total cover from the rear. The ballista itself can be damaged via brute force or magic but resists piercing and slashing damage. It is however vulnerable to lightning damage.
> 
> Ballistae can handle up to 30 points of damage, at which point they break. When a ballista breaks, roll 1d6: on a 1 or 2, the ballista explodes dealing 4d6 lightning damage to the operator. Anyone standing within a 5 ft. radius must roll a **DC 12 Dexterity** save, and suffer the same damage upon failure, or half as much upon success.

### A4 – Whelk Ballista Deposit

In this area, four whelk ballistae are stored. They are large, moveable electric weapons, which use the shell of whelks as energy storage. Sahagins know how to operate them and will rush to them at the first sign of conflict. When no alarm has been sound, they are guarded by two **Shelfsclaw** sahagins.

Ballistae can be operated or sabotaged. Successfully operating a ballista requires a **DC 17 Intelligence** check; characters who are proficient in handlings land vehicles have proficiency on the check. Refer to the infobox for instructions on what can be done on a ballista.

Sabotaging a ballista requires a **DC 12 Dexterity** check: using thief tools with proficiency gives advantage. If the check scores less than 5, the ballista emits a jolt dealing 1d4 lightning damage to the person sabotaging. A sabotaged ballista explodes the next time somebody tries to operate it, dealing 4d6 damage to the operator and making it inoperable.

Alternatively, a lightning crystal can be tossed directly inside the ballista shell. The ballista short-circuits, emitting smoke and becoming inoperable.

### A5 – Sahagin Vault

What looks like the opening of a natural cavern is obstructed by a wide and weird waterfall: water flows from a thin entrance above and sinks below into what looks like an equally thin fracture in the terrain.

Interaction with the waterfall reveals that it is as solid as cobblestone and impenetrable. Mechanical tests confirm that there is no opening and trying to sway the water flow does not alter it significantly, but just keeps flowing below magically.

On the side of the waterfall, there is a large seashell that is hung with a weak cord. Upon inspection of the wall beside, it is possible to see something written in sahaginspeak, etched on the edge of the rocky surface.

<div class='descriptive'>

_Since you morons keep forgetting the password, just use the seashell!_

</div>

Used on its own, the seashell does not do much. It does not interact with the waterfall, nor emit any sound when blown into. However, if listened closely, the seashell emits a subtle hissing sound. The hiss sounds vaguely like sahaginspeak, but it is unintelligible. The resemblance is evident for anyone speaking the language, or with a **DC 15 Intelligence** check.

If the shell is filled with water, its surface starts vibrating gently, forming ripples that propagate endlessly at its borders. A person capable of understanding the Sahagin tongue would hear the word "_indigo_" when nearing his or her ear. Repeating the same word in sahaginspeak in front of the waterfall makes it lose its solidity, allowing access inside.

Here are some ways the party can understand the mechanism and gain access to the inside:

- One of the Coral Tridents can be coerced/charmed into opening the entrance.
- The inside of the seashell is wet. With a **DC 12 Nature** check, a character knows that some Sahagin words have meaning only when uttered underwater.
- If one of Novv's children is following the party, he can translate the writing and suggest that the seashell is meant to repeat the password but that it does not work for some reason.
- If the group has not revealed its presence yet, a Sahagin periodically (about every half hour) comes checking the vault: he fills the seashell with the water pouring from the waterfall, listens to the password, then repeats it and passes through.

#### Inside the Vault

From within, the cavern is a small area that used to contain the Tridents' most precious goods. There are two cages inside, which contained two of Novv's children. With a **DC 15 Investigation** check a player can realize that they have been escorted outside of the cavern very recently, less than an hour ago: it is clear from the set of webbed footprints that go from the cages to the outside.

There are also a bunch of empty crates: with a **DC 15 Arcana** check, it is possible to realize that there is a lingering concentration of water aether around the crates, which implies they used to contain a stock of water crystals of high quality. While most of them are gone, three lesser quality crystal clusters have been left behind (**Dim Water Crystal Clusters** , **FFWC**  **13**).

On the side opposite to where the water crystal can be found, there is another chest filled with empty, neutrally aspected crystals. They are used as batteries to power up the ballistae and recharged through the exploit of the elks. Two almost spent crystals have still some lingering charges though (**Dim Lightning Crystals, FFWC 13**).

Finally, a larger crate contains raw precious materials from the Sahagins' activities: most are of little worth, but a few chunks of coral and some raw pearls can be salvaged (for a total of 30'000 gils in value).

Your attention is drawn to a chant coming northwest. As you get closer, you end up in a large bay. An islet stands in its middle connected by a thin stripe of sand. Two young white scaled Sahagins are cuffed and on their knees, guarded by two others from the Tridents. An elder Sahagin, wearing what looks like a monstrous shell in the guise of a hat, is conducting the prayers of several other Sahagins from the shore.

The priest spots you in the distance: you can't well see his face, but you are sure he's not happy with your presence.

_Kill the ssshorewalkers! Don't let them interrupt the ritual!_

The Sahagin Priest, leader of the Coral Tridents, has gathered here his most loyal servants and is preparing to summon Leviathan, Lord of the Whorl, the fishmen's deity.

Using the gathered crystals, and the fervor of his devoted, he plans to further the ritual by sacrificing Novv's children and the eggs he was bestowed. He is currently conducting the ritual from the islet, guarded by two **Sapsa Shelftooth** and a **Sapsa Shelfspine**. 

The two **Shelftooth** are maintaining a **Wall of Water** around them and the Priest. They are focused on keeping the area of the ritual clear and will cast **Tidal Wave** on any approaching enemy. The Priest is similarly defensive for the duration of the ritual: he casts **Dispel Magic** on any character approaching via air thanks to the **Fly** spell.

The bay has two shores beside the islet: on each, one of Novv's children is held captive and guarded by a Trident soldier. Crates of high quality Water Crystals are scattered all over the place, guarded by more soldiers, all praying and chanting with the elder, until commanded to attack, at which point they rush towards the party.

Each shore and captive is guarded by a **Sapsa Shelfclaw**. Another low-rank soldier is keeping the hostage in place ready to sacrifice him as per the Priest's instructions. They are not meant to participate in fight and will flee underwater if their guardian (the Shelfclaw) is defeated. If needed, use the Sahuagin (**BR 343**) stat block for them.

- On turn one and two, nothing happens.
- On turns three and four, one of Novv's children is sacrificed.
- On turn five, the priest squashes some of the eggs in his hand.

On turn six the ritual is complete. This force concludes the first fight, as any remaining enemy sahagin, except the Priest, is absorbed to fuel the summoning. In the process, all Water Crystals dissipate to give form to the Eikon.

As soon as the guards are dispatched, one way or the other, and the wall of water dissipated, Beatrix rushes to injure the priest, who ends up botching the ritual. As a result, only a fragment of Leviathan's power is conjured: Leviathan Effigy comes to birth.

> ### Actions
> ***Tail sweep.*** _**(Recharges 5-6)**_: Leviathan makes a sweeping attack with its tail. Each creature in a 15 ft. cone must pass a DC 16 DEX saving throw or suffer 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and be pushed back by 15 ft. On a success, they suffer half as much damage and are not pushed back.

> ### Reactions
> ***One with the sea.*** Leviathan can freely control water within 120 ft of its body. As a reaction whenever a creature becomes closer than 5 ft. to any free body of water (exclude those occupied by Leviathan's body), Leviathan tries to grapple it. If it succeeds the target is restrained as tendrils of enchanted water envelope it.<br>
><br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the creature's turn, if it fails to escape, it gets dragged by 5 ft. closer to water. A creature that gets dragged under water, or is restrained under water, takes 10 (2d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage at the beginning of its turn. After 3 turns it starts suffocating, unless it can breathe under water.<br>
><br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an action, another creature can disentangle the tendrils, freeing the target creature.
> ### Legendary Actions
> Leviathan can take the following Legendary Actions. Each action can only be used once, at the end of another character's turn. These actions are available progressively, one per each round, and must be expended before the round ends.
>
> **1. Liquify.** Leviathan loses its corporeal form temporarily and disappears under water. While in this state, it cannot be targeted, suffer damage or perform any action.
>
> **2. Rejoining.** Leviathan absorbs aether from its believers. Any follower of Leviathan within 300 ft. is immediately killed: Leviathan gains as many temporary hit points as the killed followers had, up to a maximum of 50. It then reemerges from any point of water, becomes targetable again and can now perform all of its actions.
>
> **3. Spinning Dive.** Leviathan liquifies again. It immediately reappears from any point in water within 300 ft. and comes rushing towards another point in a straight line. Each creature in a 20 ft. wide line must make a DC 16 DEX save or suffer 14 (4d6) damage and be pushed back by 20 ft. On a save, they suffer half as much damage and are not pushed back.
>
> **4. Tidal Wave.** Leviathan unleashes the power of the sea. Each creature within 120 ft. from Leviathan's head must pass a DC 14 WIS saving throw or gain one level of enthrallment. They must also pass a DC 16 CON saving throw and suffer 17 (5d6) cold damage on a fail, or half as much on a success.

#### The Lord of the Whorl

The incomplete ritual gave birth to an unstable, feral and unwitty version of the primal. Leviathan Effigy appears like the real counterpart, but its body is translucent and looks like it's made of water. It can hover on ground freely but must remain near water or progressively lose consistency.

At the beginning of the fight Leviathan's form is still unstable, and quickly dissipates under water, unable to react. The Sapsa Priest is left alone fighting the adventurers for about two rounds, at which point he gets absorbed by Leviathan with its Rejoining action.

The aim of the party would be to retrieve the eggs on the other side of the islet, a task which is complicated by the murderous priest and the eikon. The most straightforward way is to defeat them in combat, but other options are possible:

* A character capable of flying can try to circumvent both enemies and snatch the eggs, but the ceiling is about 30 ft. high which keeps them low enough to be in reach of an opportunity attack from Leviathan. The Priest can also cast Dispel Magic to interrupt any magic-based flight.
* A skilled swimmer can risk swimming around the beast, but it is susceptible to its **One with the sea** reaction.

If the group manages to snatch the eggs fleeing and saving their skin is always an alternative.

If Beatrix is with the party, she focuses her efforts in shielding them from the risk of tempering. She spends her turns forming a magical barrier around her: the barrier is a 120 ft. radius sphere. It forms right before Leviathan unleashes its Tidal Wave attack, at which point she urges the party to gather around her. Characters inside the barrier take only half damage from Tidal Wave and do not suffer the effects of tempering.

### Aftermath

Once Leviathan is defeated, it dispels into a burst of aether and loses its unstable form. After his death, the priest left his Staff of the Whorl, a potent magical staff.

Any remaining Sahagin panics and retreats to water, leaving the party free to take any survivor and the eggs back to Novv. Any of the children who have not been saved are permanently taken away, never to be found again.

\columnbreak

## Back to the Nursery

As soon as the eggs are returned to Novv, one of them starts to twitch in his hands, breaks up, and lets go of a little Sahagin tadpole. Much to his surprise, the hatchling is a female: a very rare event, as all female Sahagins are candidates to be the next matriarch.

Even should the party manage to return the bare minimum (that is, the handful of eggs spared the ritual at the very last moment), Novv vows eternal friendship with the adventurers. Should more of Novv's children be saved, however, he is even the more grateful and awards the party with extra rewards

Now that the party has earned Novv's trust, he agrees to lend his help to reach the Isles of Umbra.

| Saved Clutch members | Extra Reward |
| --- | --- |
| 2 or less | None |
| Between 3 and 5 | Sahagin handcrafted artifacts for a value of 10'000 gils |
| All 5 and all eggs | Sahagin Scale Armor |


<div class='descriptive'>

_You sssee, we Sssahagins have a natural affinity for water. We can manipulate it to a certain extent, pray to our God for protection – the true god Leviathan, not the fake eikon the Tridents worship._

_Through Him, our conjurers can deflect the thunderous storms of Umbra, and reach unssscated their shores. I will lend you the help of young Pahh, not only he's a formidable Elbst trainer, but he also knows the incantation so well he should be able to shield one of you ssshorewalkers's ships._

Novv calls out to a young, muscular Sahagin in his middle teens. Pahh introduces himself to the party, and under recommendation from Novv agrees to follow them in their journey.

# PART III
##### Sirius Matters

</div>

<div style="margin-top:400px"></div>

# Journeying to Umbra

Pahh is ready whenever the party is. He suggests a nearby bay as a rendezvous point, pointing out that albeit his people are peaceful, the inhabitants of Aleport might not be too welcoming for a Sahagin. The party should now communicate to their pirate contact where to reach them and when, either by returning to Limsa to tell him in person or via linkpearl.

Whichever crew is sent, its members are not too happy to welcome a Sahagin onboard – but a job is a job, especially when it comes by the very captain's orders. Thanks to Pahh's help, the road to Umbra is smooth and without issues. As soon as the party's ship approaches the thunderstorm around the isle, Pahh summons his incantation.

<div class=descriptive>

_Lord of the whorl, mighty and deep, this humble servant beseeches you. Lord of the Indigo, who gifted us reason, serpent almighty who entrusted us limbs, shield us from levin, carry us ashore!_

</div>

Pahh's spell produces a dome of water large enough to just engulf the entire ship. It deflects all incoming thunders and tidal waves and quells the seawater inside of it. However, it does not control the winds, therefore the stormy gusts can pose a threat that requires the helmsman's complete concentration.

Penetrating through the storm takes about one hour out of a six-hour trip from Pahh's suggested bay, during which both he and the helmsman must not be distracted. If they lose concentration either the spell loses form, or the ship falls prey to the wild winds.

As you get closer to the island the rainstorm dissipates, and you are presented with a majestic, sad, and yet somehow charming sight: the towering structure of Pharos Sirius, which once led too many sailors from all over Hydaelyn to the haven of Aleport. The lighthouse still emits one form of light, but not one of comfort: the eerie light of a colossal, irregular crystal which erupts from the tower's interiors, solidified aether erupted when Dalamud's shards hit the structure five years ago.

_Land ahead!_

You hear the lookout shouting, and immediately all hands onboard move like frantic ants, preparing for landing.

</div>

</div>

### A1 - Landing Area

Once reached Umbra's shores, the ship is relatively safe, as the isle is within what could be defined as "the eye of the cyclone". The pirate ship drops its anchor and the party – accompanied by the ever-present Beatrix and doctor Sebeku – can start exploring the island and looking for an entrance to the lighthouse.

From where the ship landed, the lighthouse is immediately visible to the right. The first and obvious path is a short staircase through a dismissed and rusty gate, which leads towards the main entrance. However, it is not the only entrance to the tall building: one is accessed from the sewer drain, while the other is a slightly more hidden service entrance through a collapsed path.

\pagebreakNum

### E1 - Main Entrance

The moment any player even tries to peek through the lighthouse door they immediately realize that the situation does not look good. Rabid monsters roam in and about, growling and howling, and the area is covered in a thick orange fog which makes it painful to breathe. Refer to the ground floor section for a description.

### E2 - Sewers

The strip of sand where the party landed extends further to the right. It follows a rocky wall that separates the higher plateau where the lighthouse is located. The path takes a turn following the shape of the island until it stops at a weak stream coming from inside a cave where the rocky wall ends. Following the stream inside leads to a rusty gate, and eventually into the lighthouse sewers.

### Lighthouse basement

The stream originates from a larger room in the basement, where a huge machine, the aether pump, is located. The pump collects water from the natural geothermal springs under the island. It then separates the fire and water aether components: the former is collected as fuel and sent upwards to the aether compressor, located on the third floor, while the latter is expelled as pristine water to the sewers.

Past the pump there is a closed but unlocked door, which leads to a set of stairs climbing up, leading to the ground floor.

#### Operating the pump

On the front side of the pump, from where the party came, five valves can be manipulated freely. Each valve has a small arrow tip, and each can be felt stopping when rotated about ninety degrees. This means that the arrow can point towards either of four directions: up, right, down, or left. In the beginning, all arrows point upward.

At the base of the valve lies a mummified dead body, wearing worn-out robes that look like those of a maintenance worker. A small journal peeks from one of his pockets. Its pages are mostly worn out or unreadable due to the ink being faded by water stains. From what little can be gathered, it seems to belong to a former engineer of Naldiq & Vymelli's. Fortunately, the last page is still intact.

<div class='descriptive'>

_If you are reading this, it must mean I am no more and that I moved forward to the afterlife._

_If that is the case, let me at least tell you my story, that you can proceed up ahead, without an injury._

_I came to these shores with my colleagues, all right and true, to see the state into which lied the lighthouse._

_Little did we know that the air was noxious, and one by one they all fell to madness, turning into malevolent monsters until I was the only one left._

_If you are here, you are probably undergoing the same effort, and so I beg you, heed my voice of advice._

_Forsake all I did, turn to the opposite path as mine, lest you meet your demise: it is the only way to fix this place._

</div>

Each sentence hides a direction. In sequence they appear to be the following:

<div class=descriptive>
Up, up, right, left, down.
</div>

#### Correct answer

The engineer mentioned _turning_ _to the opposite path_, and in fact, the correct order in which to turn the valves is:

<div class=descriptive>
Down, down, left, right, up.
</div>

As the players turn the valves this way, they can hear the flow of aether in the tubes stopping gently. If they now go to the ground floor, they will notice the area is no longer filled with gas (although the air still feels heavy, it is harmless). The rabid beasts have fallen asleep now that they are missing their sustenance. They will not notice the party unless attacked.

#### Wrong answer

If the players try to turn the valves into the non-inverted direction, they suddenly hear an explosion coming from the floor above. The door leading to the staircase bursts open after a pipe breaks nearby. Suddenly, gas starts seeping inside the room, as the rabid beasts howl and rapidly invade the underground passage: refer to the ground floor section for their numbers and statistics.

They engage the party while the gas is still being pumped: unless the flow is arrested by turning the valves the correct way, the players start taking increased damage each round: 1d4 on the first turn, 1d8 on the second, 1d10 from the third turn onward.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/hPBg2b4S/Isle-Umbra-Graveyard.webp" class="map">
</a>

</div>

### A2 - The ship graveyard

From where the party landed, the ship graveyard is a short walk forward, through a relatively wide path in the sand enclosed by a rocky wall. The path eventually opens towards the other side of the island, on a large bay littered with the pieces of countless wrecked vessels. Broken crates and barrels are everywhere, their content either lost to the sea, eaten by beasts, or gone to rot.

A few goods can still be salvaged from the most recent shipwreck: among the rubbish, on two opposite sides, there is a crate with some still usable weapons (four common weapons of choice about 5'000 gil in worth) and another with jewels worth 10'000 gil.

A dead sailor's journal lies buried in the sand, almost completely unreadable. Only one entry is somewhat intelligible.

<div class="descriptive">

_Today we welcomed the T---- ---head. She sure looks pretty, and ain't half bad with a lyre. B--- --s s--bborn as a goat that one, and capt'n --ready 'nging from 'er lips. I'll need many drinks fer this voyage._

</div>

The entry dates back five years in the past and it belongs to a sailor from (the real) Beatrix's ship when she first boarded from Kugane to reach Vylbrand, to whom he refers as "the Thavnairian redhead".

### E3 - Service Entrance

From the ship graveyard, a small path leads uphill, up to the elevated level of the lighthouse. Before the bay took its infamous name, the ship graveyard used to be a landing point for the engineers from Naldiq & Vymelli's sent for maintenance. They needed quick access to the building and therefore a service entrance was added in the vicinity.

The door is completely shut, and no amount of force, nor magical blast seems to pry it open. The door itself has some very odd engravings: six symbols, one for each element (wind, ice, fire, water, lightning, and earth) are piled on a column on the left side. Each is connected to what looks like a meter on the right side, which has four levels.

Left to the door, there is a queer button pad. The pad is a grid of four-by-four buttons. Each column and row is marked with a number from zero to three: 3-1-2-3 for the columns (left to right) and 3-2-3-1 for the rows (top to bottom). When a button is pushed it stays pressed, but it can be pushed again to be un-pressed. Unless the puzzle is solved, the pad resets itself after nine buttons are in the pushed state.

\pagebreakNum

Most of the buttons have no label, except for six of them (see picture below), which sports a small crystal-shaped symbol. Each crystal has a weak faded tint representing its element (red for fire, blue for water, green for wind, etc.).

When the crystal buttons are pressed the corresponding symbol on the door lights up, and the next segment on the meter is filled. If five crystal buttons are pressed, the meter overflows, the light fades and the puzzle resets itself. If two opposing elements are pushed in succession (that is, they fill two consecutive segments on the meter), they neutralize each other, the light fades from the door, and the puzzle resets itself.

For example, pressing the fire crystal button, then any other button, then the wind button, causes the puzzle to reset. However, pressing fire, then earth, then wind, is fine (there is no conquest or submission between fire and earth or earth and wind).

> ##### Element conquests and submissions
>
> In the world of Hydaelyn, elements are bound by relationships of superiority over one another called _conquests_ and _submissions._ In order, they are the following:
> 
> - _Earth grounds Lightning._
> - _Water erodes Earth._
> - _Lightning boils Water._
> - _Fire is extinguished by Wind._
> - _Ice is melted by Fire._
> - _Wind is obstructed by Ice._
> 
> If two elements are bound by one of these relationships, they neutralize each other within the door mechanism. For further information, refer to **FFWC 12.**

#### Correct code

To open the door, the buttons must be pressed in such a way that the numbers on each row and column is the same as the number of its pushed buttons. Furthermore, out of the six labeled crystals, four of them must also be pressed.

Once the pad is correctly set up, the door emits a mechanical sound, and can now be opened. The entrance leads to a dimly lit staircase that runs through the borders of the lighthouse tower and connects to every floor. Access to the third floor is impossible because the walls have collapsed, interrupting the ascent on the second floor.

#### Hints

Especially for players unfamiliar with the game's settings, consider showing them a picture of the elemental wheel and provide them with a basic explanation of the elements' relationships.

# Pharos Sirius

After finding one of the entrances, the adventurers find themselves within the broken and dismissed building of Pharos Sirius. Their steps echo feebly within its empty halls, and the only sounds they hear are the distant dripping of water, the broken pipes hissing as noxious aether erupts from within them, and the howling of those monsters which adapted to the environment and are now feeding on the twisted element.

Once upon a time, during its peak glory, were they to enter these halls they would have looked much different: a peak of human ingenuity, perfectly calibrated machines, and a maze of intricate yet perfectly logical tubes pumping energy into the lighthouse fuel chamber, where it would light its lamp to bring hope and guidance to all ships inbound for Aleport.

But now all that seems lost, and all machines are either malfunctioning, inoperable, or just plain shut down. In all its fury Bahamut and the erupting Dalamud were certainly not concerned with men's machinery or caring for their "after".

The lighthouse is a tall building extending for five floors, not including its sewers. All entrances connect to the ground floor in one way or another, while the second floor can be accessed by bypassing the ground floor using the service staircase. As for the subsequent floors, they must be traversed in sequence.

As soon as the party enters, Sebeku takes an odd instrument out of his pockets.

<div class=descriptive>

_Interesting… very interesting. I don't like this place any better than you, but it seems our target objective is all the way to the top. I'm not sure what it is yet, but I can sense a strong aetherial disturbance coming from above. I can't make my report until we have investigated that._

</div>

### The corrupted aether and the siphon

Since Dalamud's shard hit the lighthouse, the entire building is permeated by a noxious, orange fog. The lingering will of the Dreadwym is strong enough to cause a mild form of tempering in case of overexposure – which, however, the aetherial siphon can prevent.

A character who spends six hours without the protection of the siphon suffers one level of tempering. The condition is worsened to two levels after spending a whole day without the siphon's protection.
 
The siphon can be upgraded by providing Sebeku with rare materials:

##### Tomestone

The siphon can store corrupted aetherial energy in excess. The owner can expend this energy to either:

* Have advantage on a single ability check, attack, or saving throw.
* Cast a level 1 spell they know and have prepared.

The stored energy dissipates upon use and requires eight hours to be recharged.

##### Auracite Shard

The siphon's effects have an extended radius. Its protection applies to every creature within a fifteen feet radius. Creatures within five feet who are depending on corrupted aether for sustenance (see following section) suffer 1d4 of damage every turn. The effect does not stack for multiple surrounding siphons.

### Monsters of the lighthouse

Multiple creatures have either adapted, or have been originated from the influx of the noxious aether of the lighthouse. Use the following table to identify the stat block for each mentioned monster.

| Monster  |  Stat Block | Notes |
|:---|:-----------|:-|
|  Scurvy Dog  | Dire Wolf | Medium Size |
| Corrupted Sprite | Dust Devil | |
| Corrupted Pudding | Ochre Jelly | |
| Crystal Zombie | Ghast | |

</a>

</div>

A lot of the passageways on this floor have collapsed, providing little mobility. Right in front of the main entrance, four **Scurvy Dogs** and a **Corrupted Sprite** all roam in and about, posing a dangerous threat. The entire area is enveloped in a thick, orange fog which makes it difficult to breathe: anyone standing in it takes 1d10 of damage every round.

Were the group to ignore the threat they would immediately be engaged in a deadly fight with the monsters, while the corrupted aether drains their energies away. The only way to secure the area is to stop the aether pump from the sewage: refer to the entrance section for a description of the area.

If the zone is cleared, it can be traversed with ease: the Scurvy Dogs fall asleep while the Sprite has dissipated for lack of aether. Near where the monsters lay, there is a small storage room that can be explored and looted for some utility items: a few flasks of lantern oil, assorted augmentation materials that can be applied on a weapon to deal an extra 1d6 per attack for one hour (enough for three), and an abandoned sack containing 5'000 gil.

## F2 - Second Floor

<a href="https://i.postimg.cc/C5C33XMw/Pharos-F2.webp" target=_blank>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/C5C33XMw/Pharos-F2.webp" class="map"/>

</div>

The staircase to the second floor ends and gives access to a peripheral corridor that connects to two of the four support towers of the lighthouse. Access to the third floor is past the control room, but it is blocked due to an electrified flooded corridor. The only way through is by finding a way to disable the electricity flow.

### Control Room

This room is used to regulate the electrical parts of the facility. Furniture is lacking, save for an old damp table without drawers. On its top, there are several blueprints and assorted documents scattered. A toolbox with some metallic tools and spare parts sits in one corner, probably for maintenance work.

Past the room is a door leading to a flooded corridor. One of the panels on the floor was damaged during the shard impact, and it is now exposing some floored wires. As a result, the water is strongly electrically charged. Anyone approaching it would receive a jolt to any metal object it is carrying. Stepping into the corridor is deadly while the current runs: anyone trying to do that receives 10d10 lightning damage. Furthermore, part of the ceiling in the middle of the corridor is collapsed, leaving a small one-foot-high passage that must be crawled through. Tossing any metal object into the water while the current runs (for example, from the toolbox), causes a visible jolt to leap from the water towards the object until it sinks.

\pagebreakNum

Across the wall on the left side of the entrance stands a large machine with several meters, buttons, and levers. The central part contains four large levers, each with an unreadable worn-out label and a graduated scale on the right side, ranging from 0 to 3. Each lever is of a different color, left to right: red, blue, green, yellow. Standing in front of the machine, on the leftmost side, there is a hanging journal connected to a chain tied to the machine.

The journal is filled with technical jargon explaining how to operate the terminal to reduce or increase the power to each part of the facility. The labels on top were supposed to indicate what each lever was controlling, but they cannot be read anymore. One page, in particular, contains instructions on how to shut down the power altogether in case of need.

<div class="descriptive">

To completely stop the electric output, ensure that the levers are all set at the following levels:

- Aether Pump: L2
- Light System: L0
- Aether Compressor: L1
- Main Lamp: L3

Then press the large red rectangular button on the left side of the panel.

</div>

Slightly after that, somebody added some handwritten notes.

<div class=descriptive>

_Please don't ever ask why it has to be this complicated. But just so you know, never hire a Lalafell named Chalito Zukalito. We had to deal with his "legacy", and this is the result._

_Also, DO NOT TRY to press the button unless all levers are in the correct position. We barely had time to deliver this system as it is, so gods know what happens in all other cases._

</div>

#### Solution

Scattered across the same floor there are hints at which lever is which. Once gathered, they can be summarized as:

- The lever to the aether pump is not the second one.
- The lever to the aether compressor is either green or red.
- The red lever must be below L3.
- The first lever must be pulled to one of the extremes.

The third and fourth clues uniquely identify the red lever as the light system one: it must be at the extremes but not at L3, so it must be at L0. The first clue hints that the aether compressor lever is either green or red, but we just identified the red lever so it must be green. Since the red and green lever have been narrowed down, and the aether pump cannot be the blue lever (second clue), it must be the yellow one. This leaves by exclusion the blue lever to be the main lamp. The final arrangement of the levers is thus the following:

| Position | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color | Red | Blue | Green | Yellow |
| Target | Light System | Main Lamp | Compressor | Pump |
| Level | L0 | L3 | L1 | L2 |

If all levers are positioned correctly when pressing the button, the machine whirrs for a little bit, then quietly shuts down. Testing the water with a metal object confirms that it is harmless.

In all other cases, roll a d4 to determine what happens.

| Value | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | The machine overloads: the operator takes 2d10 lightning damage. |
| 2 | A nearby pipe bursts open, intoxicating all presents. Everyone suffers 1 level of exhaustion the first time and 1d10 poison damage subsequent times. |
| 3 | A dense orange liquid drips from a leaking tube above and rapidly expands into three **Corrupted Puddings**. |
| 4 | A nearby display shows the message "CH4L1T0 RUL3Z" for a few seconds. |

### North-West Room

Six sleeping crystal zombies have made this room their un-life house. They do not care about any passerby as long as they are not directly disturbed.

On the ground, near one of them, there are the scattered pages of a log. They mostly contain descriptions of daily maintenance routines and notes on the states of the machine. One of the pages recites the following near the end:

That's it. We are getting rid of Chalito. That insufferable popoto-brained pigmy is out of a job. His latest prank was switching the plates of the control room. One of the new guys tried to boost the Aether Pump, but its plate had been placed on-

the page ends there, supposedly to be continued on the next. One of the zombies nearby is holding tight to a large folder, blabbering nonsense in his sleep. The players can try to snatch it without alerting the zombie (**DC 15 Sleight of Hands**), but in case of failure the zombie wakes up, screams, and every one of its companions attacks.

Fail or succeed, the folder contains the second part of the report.

-the second lever. That was NOT fun. It could have caused some serious damage!

**Control Room Hint 1** : _The Aether Pump is not the second lever._

\pagebreakNum

### North-East Room

Most of the lighthouse construction is in classical Eorzean fashion, filled with old pipes, pistons, analogical meters all controlled by magic. That is why this room almost looks alien: from side to side, it is covered in screens, electronic meters, and other devices which resemble more Garlean technology. While most of the monitors are dim, the few ones which are still in function emit an eerie pale blue light. The data they emit are almost unintelligible: they seem to refer to some measurements of sort on the local aether, but all values are off the scale.

The room was part of an expansion commissioned by Naldiq & Vymelli's to the former Garlean engineer Chalito Zukalito, infamous among his colleagues for his incomprehensible contraptions and insufferable pranks. During the Calamity, Zukalito died as a result of Bahamut's rampage, out of a job, in the streets of Ul'dah. His strong character and will to live, however, resulted in his ghost clinging to the material plane, sucked in by and unable to escape the monitoring room to which he dedicated so much of his life. Albeit his memories are somewhat foggy the afterlife has not changed him one bit. He haunts the second floor, bored to un-death, waiting for someone, _anyone_ to pass by. And it seems like the occasion might just present itself…

Chalito lies in wait for the adventurers to step inside the room, hidden and incorporeal. He can control the large mainframe of the room to his will, turning lights on and off, printing any form of text he likes, and occasionally zap any adventurer who gets too close, dealing 1d4 lightning damage. He aims to give them a good scare for pure amusement. However, he is also a coward and will come out and be visible as soon as anyone tries to damage the large computer.

He presents himself as _the great Chalito_, engineer extraordinaire, head of technology of the Sirius Renewal Project, an endeavor on behalf of Naldiq & Vymelli's to modernize the lighthouse to become a center of study on aetherology thanks to the strong underground aetherial currents of the area. He is a loudmouth who thinks too much of himself and spends his time devising ways to confuse and frustrate people to his own amusement.

Once done with his presentation, he gives an offer to the party: his aid in exchange for some of his earthly belongings: a Garlean camera, and his private journal. He does not know where the camera is, since he cannot leave the room, and the trauma of death caused him to lose the memory of where he hid his journal, although he is pretty sure it is on this same floor.

### South-East Room

A few scurvy dogs are in this room. Contrary to those on the ground floor, these are mild and don't bother with the party unless they get too close.

Two dogs are playing with their "toys": what looks like a camera, and some sort of journal with the title "MAINTENANCE MANUAL" embossed very clearly (despite the dog's saliva).

On the other side of the room from the entrance, there is a broken pipe exposed from the wall. A pair of dogs is desperately trying to lick the orange liquid which very scarcely drips from it. Right before the broken end, there is a shut close valve.

The objective is to retrieve both objects. These are some ways the dogs can be distracted:

- The same orange liquid drips from a similar pipe in the South-Western room. It can be used to convince the dogs to approach the party without attacking (**DC 10 Animal Handling**).
- The valve can be destroyed or opened (from distance) causing the orange liquid to quickly spill from the pipe. All dogs converge to it and start licking it.
- The dogs are susceptible to sleep and can be put to a good night's rest with the right magic or toxins.

The camera itself is unusual apparel in Eorzea, so the average player (unless it has knowledge of Garlean technology) will not be able to get heads from tails on how it works. Upon passing a **DC 20 Intelligence** check, a player gets a rough understanding of its parts and can pry it open without damaging it. Inside there is a self-taken sepia-colored picture of a Lalafell with spiky hair, a pair of opaque pince-nez, and wearing what looks like a work suit. The picture is taken in front of a machine emitting smoke, while several other similarly dressed persons scattered all over the place apparently try to fix it. Contrary to his colleagues, the Lalafell sports a devilish smile and shows his fingers in a V-shaped fashion to the camera.

As for the manual, it is a large collection of blueprints and schematics depicting the machines of the lighthouse. Most are damaged and unreadable, but there is a representation of the shutdown procedure from the control room: it is heavily damaged, but one of the levers (the red one) is shown in a non-clear lowered position. While the exact level is indecipherable, it is clearly below maximum.

**Control Room Hint 2** : _The red lever must be below L3._

### South-West Room

This modest room has one single large machine on the wall facing the entrance. To its left stands an old desk with bits and bobs of mechanical parts, tools, and a non-functional small robot vaguely resembling a large spider.

This room hosts the temperature control system, whose reconstruction was one of the first tasks Chalito was assigned to when he was hired by Naldiq & Vymelli's.

#### The Temperature Panel

On the main panel of the control system, there are eight valves with a pointy end that can each be rotated by ninety degrees, like the ones on the aether pump. Manipulating the valves does not seem to cause any effect. A hidden mechanism activates only when the valves are oriented in a secret sequence chosen by Chalito:

<div class=descriptive>

Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.

</div>

\pagebreakNum

There are two ways to guess the sequence:

- If the party mentions the temperature room to Chalito, he confesses hiding a secret there and reveals the sequence directly.
- With a **DC 15 Perception** check, a player can notice a distinguishable _click_ whenever a valve is in the correct position.

If the correct sequence is input, a secret compartment opens to the lower right corner of the panel, containing a small not.

<div class=descriptive>

_Hail fellow tinkerer! If you're reading this it must mean I'm nowhere to be found and you and I are kindred souls. Or I just chose a poor password. Whatever._

_Look, I hid my legacy in this room. If you and I REALLY are kindred souls then trust me, you have to check it out. There are two air vents in this room: one is fake, and I use it as a secret safe of sorts. My legacy is there. I'm sure you will find a way in. After all, I am thou, and thou art I! Got it?_

_CH4L1T0_

</div>

#### The spiderbot

The spider robot on the table appears powered down and unresponsive. It sports Chalito's signature engraving (his name written with letters and numbers) right on the bottom. The construction appears of Garlean technology: a player passing **DC 20 Intelligence** check gets a general understanding of the robot parts and realizes it is just missing power, which can be provided by two batteries scattered on the table. The same answer can be obtained by bringing the robot to Chalito as well.

Once activated the robot quickly stands up on its eight mechanical legs, emits a short buzz, then speaks: "AWAITING INSTRUCTIONS". The robot is a tiny creature with 10 HP and AC 10. It understands simple commands and executes tasks to the best of its capabilities. It can perform the following actions if asked to and will list them if inquired about.

##### Free Actions

These actions can be performed as many times as long as the robot works.

- PICK OBJECT: The robot fetches an object it can see and brings it to its owner.
- CLIMB WALL: The robot can move freely on walls and ceilings.
- HIJACK: The robot can remove screws, bolts, and similar small mechanical parts.

##### Energy Actions

Only one of these actions can be used per day. They consume the robot's battery, which then becomes inoperable once the effect of the action ends. The battery recharges itself by absorbing the local aether for the duration of a long rest.

- SET ALARM: Same as the Alarm spell. The robot cannot move during this period.
- CAMOUFLAGE: Same as the Invisibility spell, only on self.
- STUN: A creature within reach must pass a **DC 10 Constitution** check or be paralyzed for 1 minute. On each round, the creature can repeat the Constitution check: the effect ends on the first success.

The spiderbot obeys any command while it is within the room. If brought outside it emits an alarm noise, declaring loudly: "UNAUTHORIZED TO OPERATE OUTSIDE OF ESTABLISHED PARAMETERS. SHUTTING DOWN.". This behavior can be overridden by using the reconfiguration key inside Chalito's vault, behind the mainframe room.

#### The Prankbook

A quick scan of the room (**DC 12 Perception**) shows that, oddly, there are two air vents in the room, as it is written in Chalito's hidden message. Both vents are located 3 meters above ground, making them inaccessible without a way to climb up the wall. Air flows from only one of the vents, which can be determined by just placing a hand in front of it (if a character can reach it) or with other similar tests.

The vent can be broken using brute force or by unscrewing it using a screwdriver from the nearby table. In either case, the passage is too narrow for any medium or larger creature to fit. This leaves room for magic usage to shrink a player size, or to levitate up the fake vent. As an alternative, the spiderbot can enter the vent as well if asked to.

Inside the fake vent, more in-depth and out of sight from outside, lies a forgotten journal, surprisingly well preserved. The title, embossed in large capital letters, recites: "CH4L1T0's AWESOME PRANKBOOK!". The book itself is a long list of dangerous pranks devised by Chalito himself, which more often than not end up in some machine exploding. One page, in particular, seems to refer to the lighthouse control room.

<div class=descriptive>

_Ok so, you know you have to pull the first lever all to the extreme to start the reset sequence, right? Of course you do! Now, what if we unscrew the lever, and turn it upside down? See where I'm going? Hah, imagine some poor fellow trying it out and nothing works!_

</div>

**Control room hint 3:** _The first lever must be at one of the extremes (L0 or L3)._

\pagebreakNum

### Back to the North-East Room: Chalito's Vault

Finally reconciled with his memories, Chalito starts losing whatever form he had left while reminiscing his past "glory".

_Ehy I remember this picture! We had just inaugurated the measurement mainframe! Except, I put a shock trap on the power button. Because why the hell not? Maybe the jolt was too much. Ah who cares, look at those flames!_

_And my book…! So many ideas, so much fun…! I entrust it to you, my greatest work! No, screw the machines, but my awesome log._

_Ah right. I don't have much left. Ok quickly: you know the aether compressor? The lever is green or red. I don't remember which. Okay see you byeeeee!_

The ghost of Chalito finally loses its image, disappearing from your sight… But not from your ears.

_One last thing! There is a small surprise for you folks… if you can find my ceruleum balls!_

</div>

**Control room hint 4:** _The lever to the aether compressor is either green or red._

#### Accessing the Vault

The last cryptic statement is a hint to access a secret room behind the mainframe: one of the functioning terminals of the mainframe states: "Ceruleum Pump Control". Typing anything on the nearby keyboard makes letters appear onscreen. If the password "BALLS" is typed then part of the mainframe on the far end of the room slides to the side, revealing a secret passage.

Beyond the passage is a closet-sized room, filled with blueprints, schematics, ramblings, and writings of all sorts which are shoved chaotically inside small alcoves all over the walls. In this room, Chalito used to isolate himself in thought, in the company of a bluish lamplight.

On one of the alcoves, there is a small chip with a label attached: "Spiderbot Reconfiguration". It can be inserted on the spiderbot's back (see the southwest room), at which point a few lights on its front (its "eyes") start flashing rapidly. "REBOOT COMPLETE. PLEASE REGISTER OWNER NAME.". The first person to speak will be identified as the spiderbot's owner. The robot will obey the owner's commands, from there on, disregarding the previous limitations. The robot will also refer to its owner with whatever name it was provided, whether it was real or not.

## Floor 3 – Fuel Chamber

</div>

The staircase from the second-floor spirals around the outer wall of the lighthouse. A good part of it has been damaged by the shard's impact, leaving the interiors exposed. The staircase ends in a large, circular, indigo-colored room: the fuel chamber.

A semi-transparent floor shows that below the room run several pipes filled with a blue-hued liquid (most likely ceruleum) that miraculously survived any damage from the shard's impact. The pipes are connected to the floor below by a larger connection in the middle of the room, which then fans out and runs through the walls of the building upward, to the lamp room.

\pagebreakNum

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Z5rrPN47/ffxiv-12062021-173414-765.png" class="full-art" style="bottom:-5%;left:0%;width:100%"/>
<img src="https://watercolors.giantsoup.com/phb/phb_bottom/0003.png" class="stain"/>

The room has only two exits: one on the other side of the staircase, and one slightly to the left.

The one on the far side of the room leads to another staircase to the fourth floor, but it is inaccessible: a massive, angry-looking, blue feathered bird has made its nest very close to it. The cloudkin (a Zu) is lying on it, protecting its eggs with both of its wings. Its gaze is fierce and will immediately warn anyone approaching it with a shriek. If anyone gets too close to the Zu, it attacks without hesitation (see stat block).

The reason the Zu is so aggressive is that one of its eggs has been stolen. A player who passes a **DC 12 Animal Handling** check can easily realize so. Similarly, with a **DC 15 Nature** check a player has the insight the Zus are notoriously protective towards their eggs, and similar behavior can only be explained by worry for their kin. With a **DC 12 Perception** check, one would observe that part of the nest appears to have been rummaged through, and there are chaotic traces of grease eventually leading to the other exit on the side of the room.

\columnbreak

### Om nom nom nom

The side exit leads to a fairly large balcony (15 feet wide). The border wall is damaged in multiple parts, making a dangerous fall a very concrete possibility. On one of the exposed points, not far from the exit door, is sitting a crystal zombie, carelessly hanging its legs into the void, who is attempting to "eat" a Zu egg which is larger than its head – not an easy feat when all your teeth have fallen, and your flesh is rotten.

The egg is unscathed (for the moment), if not grossly covered in zombie saliva. The zombie is too busy in its task to notice the party from afar, but it will get alarmed if it spots anyone approaching nearby. If that happens, the zombie panics, lets go of the egg (which falls from the fourth floor of the lighthouse), and flees. The egg can be secured without alarming the zombie, through stealth, sleight of hand, magic, or any other clever idea that saves it from a certain fall. Of course, trying to knock off the zombie similarly results in it letting go of the egg.

If the egg is saved it can be returned to the Zu, which immediately calms down and lets the party go without attacking. Otherwise, the Zu can still be tricked with anything resembling its egg but doing so is significantly harder. If the player offering the fake egg does not pass a **DC 20 Deception** or a **DC 18 Animal Handling** check, the Zu becomes aware of the trick, and attacks instead.

## Floor 4 – Aether Compressor

<a href="https://i.postimg.cc/DyPhHJm1/Pharos-F4.webp" target=_blank>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DyPhHJm1/Pharos-F4.webp" class="map"/>

</div>

At the end of another set of stairs, directly to the left, stands a large open space platform, built on top of another of the lighthouse's main components: the Aether Compressor. In its current state, however, it is most certainly not useful: a massive, irregular pillar of corrupted crystal erupts from the platform, growing upward like an unnatural tree. Its tendrils reach the upper floor, the Beacon Chamber, piercing through the flooring, most likely the source of the corruption that Sebeku sensed from below with his instruments. The Chamber can be reached through another short staircase, right after the platform.

To the right of the stairs leading to the floor below, is a small, isolated room, whose rusty door is half-open. The room used to be the sleeping quarter of the lighthouse's caretaker, a Roegadyn man in his sixties. He abandoned his post before the fall of Dalamud to spend what he feared could be his last days with his family.

On one side of the room is a small woodworking bench: a half-finished wooden toy of a chocobo lays on top of it, along with some carving tools. On top of it hangs a small bookshelf, mostly crafting manuals. The shelf also contains a log of daily reports, which stop at the start of the year of the Calamity, and a personal journal, where the caretaker put his thoughts and talked about his granddaughter (for whom the toy was being made).

> ##### The Caretaker's Destiny
>
> If your players feel like safekeeping the caretaker's belongings, consider setting them on his tracks. Workers at Naldiq & Vymelli's are bound to know where he retired, who his granddaughter is, and what happened to him.

\pagebreakNum

The other side of it has a busted, rotten bed and, curiously enough, an improvised bedroll made with exotic fabrics. The bedroll is completely alien to the rest of the structure and is somewhat less worn out than the many other fixtures and objects of the lighthouse. Around the floor, here and there, lie a few yellow feathers.

> ##### The Bard's Respite
>
> This room became the real Beatrix's bedroom while she was keeping company with Himerope. After the Dalamud shard fell and Beatrix became encased in the corrupted crystal, the room has been completely abandoned, and last visited by Himerope when looking for the shapeshifting amulet.

The room itself is otherwise clean and surprisingly low on corrupted aether, thanks to a still working ventilation system, making it the ideal place for a rest. Interested in examining the tree, Sebeku suggests the party resting in there, while he carries his measurement, and Beatrix offers to keep guard. In their wake, however, they find Beatrix and Sebeku to be suddenly missing…

<div class="wide">

## Floor 5 – Beacon Chamber

<a href="https://i.postimg.cc/WprTmfvW/Pharos-F5.webp" target=_blank>

</div>

<div class="wide">

Past the crystal tree is yet another ramp of stairs leading up the final floor of the lighthouse: the beacon chamber, which once hosted its lamplight, is now all but infested with the tendrils of the crystal tree.

<div class=descriptive>

As you reach the summit of the staircase you start feeling at first a weak breeze, then stronger bursts of wind as you reach a large, partly open area at the pinnacle of the lighthouse. You don't have the time to gaze at the sight of the open sea surrounding the isle of Umbra, as your entire field of view is occupied by the continuation of the erupted crystal from the floor below.

If the former structure could very well be described as a "trunk", what you are in front of now might as well be the canopy. Myriads of thin branches erupt from a smaller stub that made its way from the floor below, reaching the structure of the beacon chamber. You notice several mirrors, probably meant to reflect the beacon's light, up above your head, many of which are shattered as the tendrils of the crystal pierced through them.

</div>

</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div class="descriptive">

As you regain focus and start exploring the chamber's content with your eyes, you can't but notice the oddest detail: within the tree's "stub", at the base of the canopy, you notice a humanoid, feminine figure.

While you get closer you start to distinguish some of her traits: the creature inside resembles a Hyur, has long hair whose color you can't distinguish, and exotic vestments. But unlike any Hyur you have ever seen she has sharp claws, a pair of large, draconic wings, and patches of scales all over her body.

More importantly, her face seems a well-known one. Whatever is inside the crystal, bears an uncanny, striking resemblance to the fair-skinned bard who has accompanied you so far. Just who or what is this woman?

</div>

#### If the party chose to rest

The party finds Beatrix and Sebeku near the base of the crystal tree. Sebeku is intent on studying and taking measurements, while Beatrix looks with apprehension at the woman inside.

#### If the party chose to move onward

Beatrix moves forward to the crystal, without saying a word. Once she reaches the base, she touches gently its surface, whispering "_I'm back. Let's get you out of here, Beatrix._".

> ##### Himerope or Beatrix?
>
> From this point on, given that Himerope's identity will be revealed, I will refer to the real Beatrix, encased (for now) in crystal, as "Beatrix".

### Facing Himerope

Now finally at her dear friend's side, Himerope (disguised as Beatrix) only cares for her to be freed by her crystal prison. If pressed by the party for an explanation, she lets a long sigh and starts removing her amulet.

<div class=descriptive>

You see the red-haired bard reach for her neck. Only now you start noticing that she has been wearing a pendant beneath her shirt. As she lifts its string, you see a sudden change in her appearance: her hair becomes longer and paler in color, shifting in hue to a canary yellow. Her skin becomes whiter and whiter, almost like a corpse, and two long appendages emerge from her shoulders. In short, you see her clothes shifting and be replaced by a multitude of feathers, the same color as her real hair.

_My true name is Himerope, and I am what your people call a Siren._

</div>

\columnbreak

The players can further inquiry Himerope about her whereabouts and plans.

- She is one of the last survivors of her species, protected by her dying mother during Mistbeard's extermination.
- She found shelter in the lighthouse right before the Calamity, when the post was abandoned by their former caretakers in light of Dalamud's impending fall.
- The woman trapped within the crystal is the real Beatrix, a bard from Thavnair who shipwrecked on Umbra soon after that.
- She and Himerope became friends, but during the Calamity, as they tried to escape, Beatrix was caught in the burst of aether following Dalamud's shard impact. At that moment, she became trapped within the crystal.
- Himerope spent the next years protecting Beatrix from daring explorers and scouts from Naldiq & Vymelli's by causing any incoming ship to wreck ashore.
- Three years ago, the crystal started emanating a strong energy, and an army of monsters started gathering inside the tower. Noticing that Beatrix's body was being twisted from inside the crystal, she resolved to look for a way to free her.
- Himerope posed herself as Beatrix using a charm that she told her she found in her journeys, in hope of finding the right occasion to destroy Dalamud's shard once and for all.

By agreeing to help in the expedition, Himerope aimed at bringing Sebeku to the top of the lighthouse, hoping he would find a cure. But the look on the lalafellin scholar is all but reassuring.

<div class=descriptive>

_I'm sorry my dear, this is no simple aether sickness. Your friend has been tempered, by none less than the dreadwyrm's lingering aether within the shard. And in such an advanced state, I fear there is no hope for salvation._

</div>

Sebeku extracts a small, round device from his pockets which, according to him, can be used at the root of the crystal tree to destroy it. However, doing so will likely results in Beatrix's death, no longer sustained by the crystal's aether.

As it is to be expected, Himerope doesn't like the proposal and intimates Sebeku to give her the device. At this point, the party can try to parley with Himerope to convince her to abandon hopes for saving Beatrix, and that a merciful death is the best she can hope for. However, they soon notice a fiendish glow in her eyes: her body, and the crystal, start both to glow. The fear of losing Beatrix, the anger for her failed efforts are weakening her mind, as the lingering will of the dreadwyrm takes hold of it...

>
> **2. Dreadwyrm's Echo.** Himerope's voice is empowered by the nearby crystals. All creatures within 120 ft. must pass a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one turn. The crystal at the center of the platform shatter and Beatrix, The Crimson Rose, is released.
>
> **3. Voice of the Underworld.** Himerope combines the forces of her undead minions. All eight zombies summoned during Song of Gathering die on the spot. Two of them rise again, more powerful (**Ghast BR 311**).
>
> **4. Tinnitus.** Himerope's songs affect a creature's very soul. For 1 minute all of Himerope's actions no longer need their target to hear her.

### The Twin Roses

Failing to accept Beatrix's fate, and quickly losing control of her actions, Himerope sends a burst of energy towards Sebeku, knocking him and the device to the verge of falling down the lighthouse. She emits a bone shattering shriek which reverberates through the entire structure, as the distant wailing of the undeads follows suit.

As Himerope attacks the party, Beatrix's crystal pulsates more and more until, after a few rounds, it bursts open, letting go of the transfigured hyur within, who joins her partner in combat. 

For the duration of the fight, Himerope focuses on keeping the players occupied, preventing them from reaching Sebeku and its device or doing harm to Beatrix. The thavnairian bard, instead, has completely lost her mind, and unleashes her fury on the nearest target.

In this fight the party should aim at destroying the crystal's influence. As Sebeku suggested his device can be used on the floor below to destabilize it once and for all. However, things are complicated by waves and waves of weaker crystal zombies (use the **Zombie BR 161** stat block for them) clogging the way downstairs.

> **3. Mediated Megaflare.** Beatrix summons Bahamut's power using the power of the crystal. All character within 10 ft. of a crystal spike must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 18 (4d6 + 4) fire damage on a fail, or half as much on a success.

For the purpose of challenging your players you should consider an arbitrary number of zombies as blocking their path. If they retreat downstairs have only Beatrix chase them, while Himerope stays behind providing minimum support.

If they manage to place Sebeku's device at the crystal's base it start beeping rapidly and, after a few seconds, sends a shockwave through it. Its structure starts collapsing as its pieces crumble all over the place: the nearby zombies run away, panicked. With her connection broken, Beatrix stops attacking, as she loses consciousness.

Alternatively, defeating Beatrix has the effect of clearing Himerope's mind. All zombies lose their will to fight and retreat, freeing the staircase to the crystal tree below.

\columnbreak

> ##### Beware of the spikes!
> Most of Beatrix's actions are based around the creation of crystals and manipulation of local aether. All pre-existing crystals spikes depicted in the map are to be considered "crystal spikes" for the purpose of her attacks. The fractures on ground which connect some of them are not to be taken into account.

\pagebreakNum

## Fight Outcome

However the crystal tree is shattered, the corrupted aether dissipated from the lighthouse, and all minions retreat. As a consequence, the perpetual storm around the island dissipates as well, allowing an easier return home.

The player choices on how to deal with Beatrix and Himerope are relevant in the conflict's resolution. Here a few things to take note.

##### Himerope stops attacking once Beatrix is neutralized

Whether the party kills Beatrix or destroys the crystal tree, both her and Himerope stop fighting - the former for losing her consciousness, the latter out of regaining it. Therefore Himerope can potentially survive the fight.

##### Beatrix doesn't die when the crystal is shattered

Although the link with the crystal is severed, she merely passes out as a result of it. Therefore Beatrix too can potentially survive the fight.

##### Beatrix can, in fact, be saved

Assuming Beatrix is not outright killed by the party, and Sebeku is still alive, he starts examining the bard's twisted body until, eventually, he comes with an idea. He asks everyone to gather their aetherial syphons: now that the crystal is shattered they no longer need them but, after analyzing Beatrix's body, he thinks they could be used for restoring it. 

The only reason this is possible, he argues, is because the crystal itself was only a figment of Bahamut's power, even though a prolonged exposure was the cause of her metamorphosis.

The procedure takes a whole full day and Himerope's cooperation, thanks to her innate ability to manipulate aether, the same that shielded her during the years she inhabited the lighthouse. During this time the lighthouse is fully explorable now that the monsters have retreated and the corrupted aether has dissipated.

> ##### The Siren's Deception
> Beatrix's amulet, donned by Himerope to conceal her appearance, is a powerful magical artifact with a multitude of uses. The party is expected to obtain it at the end of the fight - see Appendix A for its details and the following section for how the party exactly acquires it.

\columnbreak

## Conclusion

The lighthouse has been thoroughly investigated by the party and they can now return to Limsa Lominsa to claim their reward. Now that the crystal has been disposed of the perpetual storm around the Isle of Umbra has calmed down: in the upcoming days, Naldiq & Vymelli's are able to dispatch subsequent clean-up missions to prepare the restoration of the lighthouse, and the trade route to Aleport is secured once again.

Within the Pharos Restoration Team, rumors and legends start spreading about machines similarly acting of their own volition, intricate and incomprehensible mechanisms that change their patterns by the day, and similarly unexplainable automation-related phenomena…

#### Only Himerope survives

The siren leaves the lighthouse soon after giving her parting words to her friend, and leaving her amulet behind. Beatrix Seaworth is nowhere to be seen in Limsa Lominsa anymore. There are voices from East, however, that tell of a beautiful, blonde bard wearing a crown of feathers, roaming the land of Thavnair, and presenting a repertoire very similar to the one of the now disappeared Rose of May.

#### Both Himerope and Beatrix survive

After Sebeku's treatment, Himerope bids farewell to the players, claiming that she has no longer a place to stay and that she wishes to think about her future. As a parting gift, she gives them the amulet she has donned for all the time of their adventure. 

The partially healed Beatrix is brought back to Limsa Lominsa for further examinations and treatment under the care of Sebeku.

A week after the party meets with a beautiful, blonde hyuran bard who very much resembles their plumed friend. She thanks them again for saving Beatrix, telling them that she has been secretly visiting in the night to make sure of her recovery. While she no longer needs to hide in her guise, she desires to travel the world with her once she's fully recovered. As for her current appearance, she confesses not really needing the amulet to shapeshift, but that it was more of a memento from Beatrix to give her strength.

This suit of magic armor has been crafted using the Sahagin's own scales, which when they become hard enough fall off naturally from their body and can be used for crafting. The base armor class for this object is 14. While wearing it, you can apply your full Dexterity modifier (instead of a maximum of +2) when determining your Armor Class. In addition, this armor does not impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

___

While worn, this item can be used to alter one's appearance, the same way as the Alter Self spell. The effect is persistent until the amulet is removed. The owner can change its form only once a day as an action, gaining the benefit of any option from the Alter Self spell. Alternatively, it can dispel its effect, but the amulet cannot be used again until next dawn. Removing the amulet counts as dispelling its effect, and likewise cannot be used again until next dawn.

  The waters of Vylbrand have always been perilous, ever more so since, after the Calamity, the lighthouse of Pharos Sirius has gone dim. 
  
  Despite their best efforts Naldiq & Vymelli's, Limsa Lominsa's renowned ironworks, have only failed over the years to reclaim their insular guide, due to the ferocious wildlife and the noxious aether permeating the building.
  
  But as words have it a lalafellin scholar of incredible talent has recently joined their efforts, with an invention that might turn the tides for the better. Now they only need a team of talented adventurers to secure the area and restore a safe route towards the shores of Limsa Lominsa.
